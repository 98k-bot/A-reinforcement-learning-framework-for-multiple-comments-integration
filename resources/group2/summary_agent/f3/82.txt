Today, NEUROMANCER may seem dated, as some note, but this single book, like the 2001, A Space Odyssey of Kubrick changed the look and tone of science fiction forever. Many of the words Gibson created changed our lexicon and he helped create a way to speak and consider the rapidly evolving digital, internet world then that we can not live without today. You may not like the characters, I did not, but he helped me grasp, as no one else, the world to come. Neuromancer by William Gibson is one of the most influential science fiction novels written in recent decades, ushering in the cyberpunk sub genre. While it is historic importance and influence should never be dismissed, the book holds up very well with a compelling plot, interesting characters and some memorable phrases. Even with the growing popularity of cyberpunk, the book remains as fresh as it was when it first came out almost thirty five years ago. This remains one of the cornerstones of science fiction novels, highly recommended. Reading this book some thirty years later still left me with feelings of nailed it, and I can see that. This sounds like present day, a must read of a book if there ever was one. With this book came the genre we know as cyberpunk, novels many years later are still using this same formula. Read the Snow Crash of Neal Stephenson, really an awesome book too, for another book, along with or based on this one that basically define a genre. That being said, if you like me are buying this edition because it will look better on your bookshelf than your battered old paperback copy, you might want to reconsider. The cover image is neat and all, but the title is upside down on the spine. This is an intentional, though baffling, design choice that is present on all copies of these Penguin Galaxy special editions. My copy of Dune came the same way and it looks like both books are upside down whenever they are on the shelf.

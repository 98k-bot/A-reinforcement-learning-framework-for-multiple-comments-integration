Good beach read and the writing is decent, but it is one of those thrillers with a lot of action and a bit light on details. I mean, you probably already noticed that it involves dolphins and aliens from other reviews, so you know what you are getting into. I read the series in about three days when I had a lot of downtime and needed something to occupy me and this was great. Probably will not recommend it to friends or read it a second time. Very poorly written, the dialog is laughably bad and I am usually pretty forgiving about stuff like and the military stuff just did not ring true to me at all. Plus the text is filled with lots of bizarrely retrograde assumptions that just seem wildly out of place in a book written. For example, we are introduced at one point to a character of Italian descent and are immediately assured by the narrator that in spite of this the character probably does not have ties to the mafia. Later, two male characters board a naval vessel and they pass a female officer and are so obviously stunned by such a sight that the captain of the ship assures them that he has found women actually make good officers. Shortly after reading this passage I put the book down for good. November is late spring and the temperatures at the coast where the research station is are in the range of 20 to 30. How about a Tsunamis caused by a seismic disturbance in the Antarctic reaching the USA in hours, 9000 miles in a few hours. I was just looking for an entertaining read and I have no science background, but the story was too disjointed and the characters one dimensional.

I am almost overwhelmed at the depth and intensity of this graphic memoir. Reading this book felt like peeking behind an unspoken curtain into some inkling of the thoughts. I was absolutely captivated both for the author and myself and I will share this digital advanced copy with my husband and hope to build the courage to share a copy with my father in law after publication. The artwork and design, for which the author is known, is complemented by a powerful and poignant writing style. As someone whose family history also descends from Germany, the entire narrative struck a chord. I recommend Belonging without any reservations. I loved this book about the author reconnecting with her family history and mixed emotions about her German heritage, the only drawback was the text or copy divided in the middle by an image. I found this incredibly annoying or difficult to read, an absolute must read. The Book was a Sobering Investigation by the Author search for Her Familial past. The path she takes us through is a journey through modern Germany and into the Darkest parts of the Third Reich. This graphic memoir is a really deep and poignant look at one self. It is a really heavy topic, but I found it awesome to experience Nora journey of self discovery cool to be done in the graphic medium. I also loved that it was not a typical graphic novel and the book was drawn as if written in a notebook. There were even real photos put into it to make it feel more real. It is kind of hit you with the truth suddenly and I do want to post a warning though, some of the images early on were a little too much to handle. We are dealing with WWII in Nazi Germany, so there are some horrific images there, so just be mindful of that if that could be a trigger, or just something you would not want to see in a book. I was intrigued by how the graphic novel format would convey the information, and I was suitably impressed.

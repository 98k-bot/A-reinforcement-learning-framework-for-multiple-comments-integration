I love the author but this book is the epitome of cheesy and obvious. I skipped over a lot of inner monologue because I could not take the optimism. Characters need flaws and they need to see other characters for who they are. That is what makes them real and Landon sees everyone in her life as too wonderful. It gets annoying and overbearing and my opinion of her has lessened just a bit, no more fiction, stick to the self help sector. The writer is a party planner, so I would think she might have thrown a bit more dirt in there. Only the bitchy boss makes for any conflict and even she is not terribly original. The story is just very light, neat and predictable and well written when it is about the party planning aspect but everything is just too predicable. No depth to characters and the plot was jumpy and I could never really get into it. Wanted to quit about halfway through but figured I might as well finish it, will not be reading book two. This novel starts out really poorly, with a plethora of dumb girl bits, but gradually gets some better as it progresses. This story is nothing new, naive girl, wicked boss and handsome stranger. If you are in to anything celebrity, you might find this more interesting than people magazine. With a little polish and a bit more mature outlook, I think this story could have read much better if it was just a bit more sophisticated and it seemed to pander to the gum chewing set. I love a good chick lit book, but this is poorly written and just not good, try some other books for a better option. I think the one thing the bugs the hell out of me is how stereotypical Landon is to what other people perceive Texans.

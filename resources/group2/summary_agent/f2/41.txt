What was the Pulitzer Group thinking, based on the Pulitzer designation and based on some of the endorsements from favorite writers, my book club chose this book and all of us disliked it. The criticisms were that the main character was uninteresting, unsympathetic and not relatable. The paltry humor was only mildly amusing, not hysterical as one endorsement said and the ending was predictable and anticlimactic. We finished reading it out of duty to the club, not because the book was compelling. The only redeeming aspect was the interesting way the author would weave past and present together in the narrative. I cannot recommend this book and the Pulitzer people need to reexamine their standards. But if you are looking for a book with interesting characters and an actual plot, look elsewhere. I am encouraged to see that I am not the only one who thought this book was not so hot. After reading all the pages of raving blurbs, I thought I would really be in for a treat, but I could not believe in it. I will admit that I laughed out loud a few times and that is a lot more than I get out of the majority of books I read. Overall it was tedious, difficult reading and I was left wondering if this book was just part of the title, a bit of irony based on older lover is having won the prize. There are some beautiful turns of phrase in here, and some good characters and an interesting story. Tried, but could not finish and I rarely stop reading a book, but this one did not capture my interest in any way.

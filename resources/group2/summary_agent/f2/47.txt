I have read previous books that have included glimpses into Lee Miller life in Paris in the 1930 and I have read factual accounts about her life as a Vogue model, life with Man Ray, as a war correspondent. This book, while fiction, brought what I have read previously into one powerful story giving insight into this complex, talented and troubled woman. How much is fiction and how much is fact is unknown but the book is absorbing and a great read and I look forward to seeing what or who will be next from this author. I will certainly buy next book and I have read biography of Lee Miller and seen scores of Man Ray photos, many of which sprung into my mind as they were described in the book. I wonder if this familiarity with their work improved, or distracted from my experience in reading this book. The Wall Street Journal review that led me to this book featured the iconic photo of Lee in Hitler bathtub, a startling visual on many levels. Man Ray experimental work adequate to describe their places in the history of photographic art. This is a wonderfully readable historical novel about the evolution of an amazing photographer, Lee Miller, through the crucible of Paris and Surrealism, and her relationship with Man Ray. Read this in conjunction with Antony Penrose and the Lives of Lee Miller should you need the pictures that go with the words. It is written from Lee perspective which is a good view to Man Ray, Jean Cocteau and other luminaries who make their way through her life. I am not normally a fan of historical fiction but an avid fan of art. Lee is an interesting character, a former abuse victim who is occasionally doubtful of her gifts. Overall, I did quite like this book and here is a fantastic writer for four star review. The author writes in such a way that you want to read the novel slowly to soak in her turns of phrases.

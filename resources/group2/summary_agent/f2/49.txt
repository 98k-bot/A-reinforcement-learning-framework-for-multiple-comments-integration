You can tell that this author is a fan of fiction and he has compiled a cast of all the typical, cliche, characters one would find in a variety of fiction stories. The story was fun, but did not have a lot of meat to it and we learned a small bit about each character, but not enough to really care about them. There is no loss, so no growth and they do not learn any lessons from hardship. Saying all that, it was a fun read, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something light to escape the trials of real life. I so want to blurt out the details but that would spoil it. This book is unique and entertaining and it reminded me of years ago in my youth when I played. Some of the reviews already mentioned the camaraderie of the young male heroes. I would also like to draw attention to the female warrior in their band and I like Titan and I believe many other readers will too. I also appreciated the healthy dose of sarcasm and I am already looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Finally an exciting and well written Fantasy series, thank you, I really enjoyed this book and just bought the other two. Loved the the book and started reading the second already. I have to say this is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. Great characters, excellent battles without all the explanation fluff. Good humor and differentiation of characters to make it work, all in all a very good read. This book reminds me of the Lord of the Rings and it is a group of beings of different races who become mercenary since they battle using cunning and ingenuity. Now, these details did nothing but prolonged the length of the story, and made the story unnecessarily too long.

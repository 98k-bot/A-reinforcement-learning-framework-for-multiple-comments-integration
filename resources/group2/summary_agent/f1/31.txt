If you are not big into long reads, and you are perfect novel is roughly hundreds pages long, you might have a hard time here, but if you are willing to give this book a go, there is something so satisfying about a self contained, one volume fantasy epic. The whole story is there, in one big volume, no waiting for sequels and I did not realize just how sequel fatigued I have been until I sat down and made my way through this book. No mentally steeling myself for a cliffhanger followed by a two year wait and I have not felt this way about an epic fantasy novel, who knew you can have an entire world confined to one volume. I devoured this book in defiance of all schedules and productivity and the joy of discovering and exploring historical analogues with dragons and witches and lesbians was incandescent. If you are at all involved it the bookish community, you will most probably have heard of The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon, coming out February 2019. Therefore, I was so excited to read an early excerpt, which in turn got me so thrilled to read the entire book when it comes out. As usual, let me start with the narrator, her skill with accents is likewise incredible. I have never listened to an audio book read by Liyah Summers before, and after hearing this I can not understand why. The narrator is absolutely one of the top talents in the business and she has impressive vocal range, giving us a wonderful assortment of voices, and even her male voices are widely varied and sound amazing. I took a chance on this novel as normally and I am very picky about what fantasy books I read.

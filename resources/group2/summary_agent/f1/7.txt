I initially thought that the novel is dedicated to the long exhausted subject of mercy killings and the novel is definitely one of author best, however, only uses this topic as a backdrop to the far more engaging subject matter. The real topic of the book is an obsessive fixation on their spouses that Allie and Jamie mistake for love. As much as one wants to blame Cam and Maggie for doing what they did, it is impossible to feel anything but compassion towards these characters. Jamie and Allie neurotic fixation is of a kind that always leads to a death of a marriage. This was one of author best and a tender heart theme weaved with striking metaphors. As usual the author theme of moral justice is stirred through the pages carefully. With just the right finesse, so the reader is not drowned by its burden. It is thought provoking to the point where you just can not put it down. So get ready for some late nights and I highly recommend. I was afraid to read Mercy and I did not want to know about someone unbelievable pain. I also did not understand the kind of love that would propel someone to kill another for any reason, but I started to read and could not put the book down. The book is so much more than I ever thought and lots of twists and turns and courtroom drama that is unmatched. The ending is Perfect and this is a must read, the author is at her best. It was hard to fault the husband for what was asked of him under the circumstances.

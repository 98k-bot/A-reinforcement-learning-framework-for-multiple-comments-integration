In reading this story you soon see it is not herself that she seeks to glorify or uplift, it is only the amazing, healing, restoring God she serves that she gives honor and praise too. Through her story she encourages the reader to look beyond the current circumstances of their situation and see how God is working through them. I encourage everyone to read Out of the Dust but not to stop with just that action. Once you have read Avis story honestly ask God to show you what he is asking you to do, then jump in with both feet and allow God to write his story on your life. All the proceeds from this book go directly to the orphanage and school. I appreciate Avis honesty and vulnerability in sharing so much personal info. Lessons learned from failures in the mission field would be a good thing to have more of, to learn from. I loved this book and it made me want to sell everything and fulfill my dream of being a medical missionary in the Congo. My parents prevented me much the same as Avis was discouraged. It is always a good reminder that God can and will use us, no matter our imperfections and lacks. The message this book holds is worth the reading, and I am praying that God will use it to inspire more of us to answer his call, wherever, and whoever we may be. This is the story of the missionary that the author has a missions in Peru where she helps women and children. Having faith in God would provide for her and protect her to help his children. As someone who does not consider themselves highly religious, I was not sure what I was going to think about this book. Avis story is one that will draw you in, along with the fact that the book reads as if she is talking to a dear friend.

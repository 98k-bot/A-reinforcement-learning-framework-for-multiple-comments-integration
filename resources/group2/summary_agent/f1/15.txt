Before starting this book, I started three different books, and could not finish any of them, some published novelists are purely amateurs and this author is a very talented writer. Finally, a book I could finish and truly enjoy and the author makes you care about her very human characters. The plight of Chinese immigrants was harrowing. I learned much about the immigration history of our country, of which I was completely unaware. I will recommend this for book club reading due to its relativity to current immigration concerns in our country. Give me your tired, your poor has had many disruptions during our country brief history, sadly. The story of Mei Ling and her horrendous trip from Asia to California was experienced by thousands. It was appalling, but the determination of so many Chinese to better themselves, study hard, work endlessly and live the dream became reality. Beautifully written and a tribute to so many and I highly recommended. The author has a gift for taking events that I have only read about in a history text book and giving them texture, depth, and heart. The characters and settings are vivid and the plot is compelling. Reasons for Chinese coming to the US were varied, but their struggles to succeed the same. In light of our present day immigration issues, this is a timely book and I look forward to reading other novels by the author. Excellent representation of the life and hard times of our Chinese citizens and the strength of a mother knows no bounds.

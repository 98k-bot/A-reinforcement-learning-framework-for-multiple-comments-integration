I can not recommend this book if you have a weak stomach and this book deals with the old debate of the bad seed child arguments. I am sure the book is well written and this just was not a book for me. If you read it, go into knowing it touches on the bad seed theory and the distinctive problems that are brought to a marriage because of it, it is not pretty. Psych thrillers are my favorite genre but this story was way too much because of the ridiculous characters. The child was so disturbed and evil and the parents are total idiots. Bring home a very disturbed child, add a pet, a new baby, and a dumb as dirt social worker and voila. A great read, not so much. The writing is very good though but the characters were too stupid to be believed and skip this one. Do not expect to feel sympathy for most of the characters and the foster care adoption process of a profoundly disturbed child seemed nonchalant, the lack of support unbelievable. But maybe that is how it really is. In all honesty, you will simply want to smack the three narrators for their utter, unrelenting stupidity. I find myself skimming while I read and drawn in by the plot and wanting to know what happens next, yet I irritated by the writing that seems to lack depth. Even more, the characters are cliched and underdeveloped. There is no distinction between the voice of Hannah. In fact, I sometimes get mixed up as to whose point of view is represented. And the child, the character really can not get a handle on her. Does not come across as a believable character and I am factoring in the trauma that defines her. I have not read this yet, and while it is the type of suspense I enjoy, I am hesitant to read it, and would like to ask those of you have read it, if I should. My husband and I adopted a foster child we knew to have behavioral issues we thought we could love away. My husband did witness some but not all, and a lot of the worst behavior was hidden from my husband.

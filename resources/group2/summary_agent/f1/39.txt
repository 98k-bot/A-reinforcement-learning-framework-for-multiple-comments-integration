I started reading True Miracles Stories That Will Increase Your Faith by Adam and god started blessing and giving me strength and peace that everything was going to work out. And the next day my son called me to tell me he was alright, thank you Adam for writing such a powerful book. This book is easy to read, packed full of truths written in a way that is easy to understand. Seekers will be satisfied and believers will be challenged and I highly recommend putting into practice the principles and concepts taught in this book. Not only does this book give accounts of God love and miracles, it gives us life and prayer instructions. He cares enough about each one of us who read this book to give us instructions for our prayer life and our relationship with the Father. I think that is the heart of the father showing forth in his son, awesome. I would recommend this book to anyone needing reminded that god is faithful. Still reading between this and When God Makes Lemonade, it lives me feeling so much closer to Our Heavenly Family that awaits us.

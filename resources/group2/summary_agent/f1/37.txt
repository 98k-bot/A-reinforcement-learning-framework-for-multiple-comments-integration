To compare this book to any story of the hardships suffered during WWII is an insult to the millions who actually did suffer. This is a self serving memoir of a rich girl successful life, an attention grab for her perceived suffering. And then, in the end you will be rewarded with the story of her successful and exciting modeling career before she goes on to marry a millionaire. Do not be misled, this is nothing more than thinly disguised complaining about travel delays and do not waste your time and money. The book would have been better in telling of the journey ended sooner or was summed up with far fewer words and details than the author used. The years following the family return were particularly tedious, devolving into more of a self promotion than anything else. I did not get the impression that the author ever had much appreciation for the misery and struggle that went on and this self satisfied and self focus took away from the totality for me. This book should never have been published. Unless you enjoy reading about privileged rich people problems, find yourself another book. Snoring account of a wealthy German, an American family stuck in Japan during WWII, and then Germany, before being able to go back to USA. The author has lived a very adventurous and exciting life. It is too bad that the style of writing makes it sound like a dull day at the park. This book is more a list of events than a true biography. This would probably be of interest if you are a relative of the family seeking family history. As book to be read by the general public, it is simply reading a strangers diary. While their families were moving from one house to another, six million Jews and millions of others were being gassed and I guess suffering is relative.

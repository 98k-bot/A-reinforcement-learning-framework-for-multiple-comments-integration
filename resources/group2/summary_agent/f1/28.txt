I read the entire Ancillary series and Loved it and great characters, great plot, great pacing, and a fascinating non standard perspective on how a space faring human or AI culture might evolve. I eagerly purchased Provenance straight afterwards, expecting another great read and the premise of the story is ordinary. None of the characters are particularly well formed and most pursue needlessly convoluted undertakings that are generally motivated by perceived emotional slights. Some of the social aspects show potential, but too often key details seem missing. It is in the same universe as the Ancillary series, but the scope got smaller that the different human races were confusing to keep separate. It was like a political thriller, but I did not really understand who the parties were, or even what was at stake. Also, the main character was to hard to be empathetic towards, she constantly was looking for approval from her mom, not really somebody you can get behind. The main character is not particularly interesting since she bounces around the crazy plot like it is no big deal. I have read and enjoyed all the work I can find from this author, until this book. The incessant use of letter for he or she and for his or her drove me crazy after a while and I had to abandon this novel. I hope you do not find this as annoying as I did, because otherwise, she is a great author. Seems like a book for teens, unlike Leckie earlier trilogy which I loved the plot is murky, relationships between the cultures is unclear. This book is worth preserving and the stories behind these, but the author never really develops this and I am hipping for a better next book. The other three books in ancillary series were awesome but this one was boring, uninspired, not really detailed.

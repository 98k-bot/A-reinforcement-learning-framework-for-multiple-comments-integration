Every American should read these poems and everyone who loves poetry should read them. Everyone who cares about history should read them and they are deeply moving and deeply humane. This poet brings together history, amazing perspectives, beautiful language and a contemporary look at native American issues entwined with the artistry of the poet. I will be using some of her poems in high school classes this year. I appreciated the opportunity not only to read beautiful poetry, but to become more educated on the native American point of view. I have heard it said that how am I supposed to understand their point of view and answer that you can begin by listening. This book helped me immensely to listen, highly recommended. A powerful voice straight from the heart that deserves to be heard by all, honest, inspiring, beautiful. Thank you, Layli Long Soldier for speaking your truth and delivering it with such elegance. Her work plays with line breaks and the way words look on a page and she puts Emily Dickinson to shame. Truly brilliant work that I will go back to read again and again, very thought provoking and inspiring. Good book of poems and the book gave me the point of view from the life of Layli Long Soldier much of which is a new way of seeing for me. I struggled with some of the poems, but poetry should not necessarily be easy.

Maybe romantic might be a stretch, basically you have two people who have nothing in common other than they are hot for each others bodies and they get absolutely wasted and ensue. Generic guy number 487, he likes Deadpool and is a divorce lawyer and he has a giant stick up his butt for everything and is not all that pleasant. I am supposed to love the protagonist since he takes more than money, a pretty body, and nice tackle. I liked the characters and the steam was definitely there but the writing seems a little juvenile otherwise. The characters did not have a whole lot of depth developed. It was like the back story were there but unfinished and it made it difficult to really emotionally connect. Julia and Nate wake up hungover in a Vegas hotel room without a whole lot of memory of their night before. The two then set out on an amusing journey to find the answers of the night before. It was not a bad read per say, it just was not good either and I felt like there were too many references to things that people who did not know that reference may not get. Most of the reviews ranted about how funny this book was, I love funny and I think they omitted the funny parts in my book. The description and the book flow was extremely choppy throughout the book, to put it mildly, this is was and forever will be a major pass. I have read a lot of books but this one I could not keep up with the story line. A romance writer experiences something like her plots while at a conference in Las Vegas. I suppose that is the point of romance novels but, for me, it detracted from the book.

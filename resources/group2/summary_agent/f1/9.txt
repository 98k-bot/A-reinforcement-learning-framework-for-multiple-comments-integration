This author pulled me into her debut novel from the very first page and it is an intense story about a young woman, Katie, trying to figure out whether her father unjustly went to prison for allegedly raping her best friend. The author writes in clear prose and builds suspense artfully and Readers will fall in love with her authentic characters. Each character is ever so human and I highly recommend this book and predict you will find yourself reading it late into the night, then picking it up the first thing the next morning. I know the author through writing circles but had never seen any of her novel previously. This is the dilemma Katie is faced with as she searches for answers as to what really happened that last summer at the lake with her father and her friend Lulu. This book kept me engrossed to the very end and I could not put it down. It took me a minute to get into this book but over all I enjoyed it. The outcome was a little crazy and I feel it could have been a little longer with going further into the other characters back stories. That was a little crazy but hey I guess this happens. Over good read. I loved this book and this brought me straight back to my teenage years. It is written so well that I read it in two days. The disillusion of grownups being perfect and realizing your parents are not all knowing, and may even be flawed. And that is not even getting into the story line, great story, thank you. This story is very deep and thought provoking and a lot of different things going on all throughout the story.

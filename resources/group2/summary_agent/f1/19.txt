This book is a thought provoking, timely novel that takes a deep look into relationships between friends, between spouses, and between parents and children. The characters in this book are so well written and complex characters who will connect with readers on so many levels. This story will cause readers to think of their own relationships, like the ones in the book, are messy and complicated, and they are portrayed in this book with insight and honesty. My emotions were taken for a ride while I was reading this book, a ride complete with ups and downs, bumpy roads, twists and turns. I was so excited to see the author as a selection for March First Reads. I have read other works by Camille Pagan and was eager to read her latest work and I was not disappointed. Enjoyably purposeful and no agenda, refreshing Insights exploring push and pull of honest commitments to strengthen friendships, marriages, families and careers were skillfully brought to life. Characters were well developed and lifted off the pages. Throughout this story, what the author offers a piercing, and even humorous at times, look behind the curtain of marriage, with all its glorious spots. I am pretty sure that there is a little bit of Penelope in all of us and I know I saw myself in her. This book was not just a riveting emotional roller coaster, but rather the story that so many women of a certain age can tell from their own lives. The characters are so believable, the text and dialogue genuine and Penny humor, sarcasm and honesty about her shortcomings, that was icing on the cake. Sometimes honesty may not be the best policy but we need to be more honest with ourselves.

Beautifully written and the author has a way of transporting you to her homeland and sways you to see Afghanistan as a beautiful place that was overthrown and crushed by horrible events. The book educates you on why some people stayed and others fled. I can not imagine the tough decisions that those parents had to make for their children and great book definitely recommend it. I could not put this book down and this book was very well written and straight from the heart. The story was relayed with great honesty and so touching to imagine how her life changed from one of privilege to one of fighting for life after the soviet army invaded Afghanistan. Ultimately the family was reunited which was a great relief after all they endured. This memory opened a door into a completely different perspective of what Afghanistan was like before the country was torn apart. I also have to thank the author for introducing me to the poetry of Hafiz and her father quotes it to her. I wish the author would write a sequel because I would like to know about their emigration to the United States and where the family all settled. It is unbelievable the trek she took as a little girl to get out of Afghanistan. I read this quickly and was very interested in this true story about immigration and being a political refugee. The topic is very relevant at this point in our own American history as we struggle to come to a new chapter in how the USA grapples with border security, a need for capable workers, and our history as a welcoming country for refugees.

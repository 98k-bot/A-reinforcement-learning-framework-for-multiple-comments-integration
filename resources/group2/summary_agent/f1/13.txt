I absolutely loved this book and I have read many stories detailing the horrors Jews faced throughout Europe before, during, and after World War II and expected this story to be similar. It was different and I connected with it far more that other stories of the same genre and perhaps knowing it was based on the author family made it all the more moving. I finished it last night and I found myself thinking about the Kurc family several times today, terrific read. I have read a lot of literature and other WWII material and I had read excellent reviews before my book club chose this for next month, so I was ready to read it. I knew how it ended, but still the unexpected and the how did it happen kept me turning pages. The characters seemed very real and the events obviously real. As an avid reader of historical fiction in WWII, this book is up there at the top. I love that it is based on the writer family, that always makes a story that much more incredible. The story follows a family of five, so it does take a little longer to follow who is who and detail each ones trek over the years, but to me, that makes it all the more fascinating. I think, as others have said, this would be the WWII book I would love to see everyone have to read, to be able to have this part of history etched in their soul, to never forget, and to appreciate all that we have so easily today and we are the lucky ones for sure. This is a horrible true story of a horrible war, a senseless horrible war that needs to never be forgotten. Please read this true story of hate, just for the sake of hate. Hopefully we can all take good things away from this true and heartbreaking and wonderful story of strength courage and love, a must read. This is an incredible story of a Jewish family survival during WWII.

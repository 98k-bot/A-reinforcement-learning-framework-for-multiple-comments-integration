The only word I can think of this book is devoured since it is one of the best books I have read in two years. Everything was right on target, characters true to life, writing style so good it flew by. For the plot, the plot was like driving a race car through a twisty road where the scenery changes at every turn and I will not forget the characters anytime soon. This book left an indelible impression and I can not wait for her next book, just blown away. I would have rated it five plus stars if that was an option, so anyway, get the book. So many times I have picked up a new book touted as a mind bending thriller with shocking twists only to figure out the culprit halfway through the full of plot holes. Not with this book, this truly is a freight train of a story, written with much skill, and a protagonist that has just the right amount of malice and wit. The end was truly not seen coming and I could not put it down once I got into the story. First off, let me admit here that I usually read at a slug pace and it takes a good story to speed me up. I read this book in just a few days and I thought it was well written, and I loved the twists in it. My only complaint would be that there is very little information out there on the story line. Anyway, many twists and turns I did not see coming and I really wish there was somewhere I could talk with folks about that ending. One of my favorite thrillers I read this year, more than a five star, completely original, scary, tense, thrilling, and chilling.

This is the classic story of the Velveteen Rabbit and it is wonderful and I recommend it for everyone, kids and adults. But be careful, this copy says it is the original edition but it is not the same as the original and I do not know about the one written in 1922 but I have a copy from 1970 and this one is different. I was expecting it to be the same as my 1970 version but this one is bigger, the cover and dust jacket are a different color from the original, the pages are a horrible shade of tan and the coloring in the photos is different. There are many cute versions of this book but it you want the original or something close to it, this is not it. My child only got through a few sentences before she told me this is not the right one. It has a girl named Hannah instead of a boy and I looked at it and my child was right, since this is not the original Velveteen Rabbit that we all know and love. Someone personalized it as a vanity project for their own kid Hannah and uploaded it as if it were the original, and gave no indication that they did this in the book description. I feel like they stole money from me and am pissed and I am glad my daughter already knew the book was supposed to have a boy, or she would have failed her school report, shame on whoever did this. I cannot believe how terrible this product is and this appears to be a bootleg copy and pages appear to be photocopied. The pages were cut improperly and so the letters slant at an angle across the page. I could not believe it when I opened this up and found that letters are not even straight across the page. Never have I been more dissatisfied with a purchase and this item needs to be removed from available products immediately.

I bought the hard copy, thinking I was going to really enjoy. I was very wrong. Did not make it past the first one hundred pages, then hopscotched through the book, but without finding much interesting stuff. Feels like reading Yahoo, fluffy news stories, not going anywhere, written for people who do not like to read much. Some of the reviews indicate that the book reads like a novel and I found the book to be tedious and boring. Perhaps if I lived on the Gulf I might have found this book more interesting. Book was used for Book Club as well as One Pass One Book, a Pass Christian civic project where author will speak. Book was interesting in some chapters but tedious in others. I am sure this is just a reflection on me, but I had really serious trouble trying to get into the book. I am interested in the Gulf itself, but the author seems more interested in the people who have been there. Then when the author gets to the various mounds peoples, instead of writing directly about them, he writes about the archaeologists who investigated the mounds and other remains. Writing about the natural elements of the Gulf is again almost entirely through the eyes of people who fish and farm there, or travel across it, and descriptions of the natural world are always interrupted by anecdotes about people. There are too few maps and other illustrations, and one map of the Gulf is identified simply as the Gulf of Mexico in the age of European conquest, which could be anywhere from 1492 to the issues over Cuba in the early 1960.

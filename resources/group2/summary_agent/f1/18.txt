I have been a long time reader of the author, and always been impressed how his books drop you right in the middle of the action from page one. The author has a unique talent for drawing you into the story without sacrificing other characteristics of great writing including character development and accurate, detailed environments. While murder, betrayal, and revenge may seem like an easy to write to, the author does it with such realism and engagement that you can not help but get attached to the characters. The author shines with this new thriller that hits the ground running and a complex thriller that satisfies the want for fast paced action and a well told story, the rescue, is a must read. The plot immediately drops the reader into a well drawn world of betrayal, revenge, and redemption. The author has used his considerable and specialized military knowledge to build a masterfully layered plot with tortured hero Ryan Decker front and center. This thrilling first book in the author new action driven series tackles issues including the child sex trade industry in the United States. Honestly, this mesmerizing, twisty story was an absolute joy to read and it kept me turning the pages until the very end. There is a new action hero in town, shades of the heroes of Hunter, Ryan Decker is the new action hero on the scene. I have enjoyed all of the books of this author I have read so far and this one is no exception. It is also more fun to read about spies and Russians and secret plots than about Post apocalyptic chaos.

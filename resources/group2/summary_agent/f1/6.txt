I had been seeing previews and reviews of this book for a few months now, so I was excited when it finally came out. Unfortunately for me, with so much hype around the book, came high expectations that just were not met after reading the book. Right away it was way too similar to Sparrow, which I actually enjoyed a lot more than this. The character was able to break free from the archaic pressures and upbringing of her parents world, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. I really enjoy this author, but some of her other anti heroes were much better than this. The story line had a lot of potential, but I feel like it was not utilized and I did not get the love triangle feel as was advertised. The story was still written well enough that it was easy to finish and I realized rather quickly where the story was going to go, but the author definitely threw in a few revelations that had me not wanting to stop. It is unfortunate that with the amount of people that read this book before it was published, they were not able to pick up on missing words or wrong forms of words used. I would recommend this book to people, as long as they knew not to judge the author by this one alone. This is a talented writer, so my rating is not a reflection of that talent. The author did a poor job of developing the character, who was so silly. The default response of the protagonist to most issues is the bawling and her cheating and indecision was tiresome. The author maintain the same level of immaturity through most of the book and found some backbone about the the most part mark in the book. The time was spent to explain the character and his motives, so there was understanding of his motives and behavior and this author has done better. Definitely my least favorite book of this author.

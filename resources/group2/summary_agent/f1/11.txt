The book could have undergone at least one more edit, assuming it had already had at least one, the four stars are for story line. Misplaced modifiers galore, missing punctuation, transitions, very few that I could go on. From the first page to the last this story grips your attention and does not let go until the end. Sometimes I believe the protagonist might be smart and other times I think she might be, but ultimately she make the correct decisions and it is okay, end well. The book was enjoyable and I loved the main character similarity to the orphan. I like a out of left field surprise but, felt this just did not make sense with the rest of the book. The protagonist is made to go live with her aunt and it actually turns her life around in all areas. The characters are so developed, some you love, some you despise, but none are forgettable. I highly recommend it, for those who like history, love, and how we sometimes have to form our on families, a book well worth reading. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast of characters which were interesting and well drawn. This WWII novel is set in England just prior to and during the war and it is important that everyone remembers the suffering and struggles of those heroes both fighting and left behind during that period of time. The only confusion was the author names cities that are copied by immigrants when they landed in their new homes. The power of love and having good social skills can overcome much of the trauma that people have endured. It is especially interesting to read what World War II was like for someone living in England. The author is a gifted and interesting writer and her ample research and dedication to historical accuracy and enjoyable reading are both evident throughout this historical novel.

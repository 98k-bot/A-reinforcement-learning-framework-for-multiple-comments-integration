This is a new and complex thriller hits the ground running and satisfies the want for fast and relentless paced action, a great can not put it down book. The story line developed rapidly and went from tense to intense very quickly and shockingly. The author Steven Konkoly, with predilection in conspiracy, has unleashed the ultimate thriller action protagonist in The Rescue. He writes the murder, betrayal and revenge with exciting realism and plausible engagement attached to the characters, dropping the readers into a well drawn world. I have been so hooked to have to wait for book two. It is more fun to read about spies and Russians and secret plots than about Post apocalyptic chaos. The author has a unique talent for drawing you into the story without sacrificing the characteristics of decent character development with a sympathetic protagonist and supporting cast and accurate, detailed environments. He use the considerable and specialized military knowledge to build a masterfully layered plot with tortured hero Ryan Decker, a new action hero on the scene, front and center, having the readers thinking they have the plot figured out just before the direction changes and leaves you trying to reorient the facts. There is a plethora of wrong doings Decker character, compelled to make right. For Ryan Decker, he is a very engaging character. I am sure he will have both back story and future adventures to carry him through a long series of entertaining books. Honestly, this mesmerizing, twisty thriller kept me turning the pages. A well told and well edit story, a must read, I enjoyed every word of it. Looking forward to reading more twist and turns in this series.

The only word I can think of this book is devoured since it is one of the best books I have read in two years. This truly is a freight train of a story, written with much skill, and a protagonist that has just the right amount of malice and wit. Lives of Lizzie, Becca and James intertwined. It takes us from a wrong message on social media to crazy story between characters. I could not stop reading until I found out what was going on. This is quite a story and you feel so sorry for the wrong person. Everything was right on target, characters true to life, written with so much skill that pretty good it flew by. The plot with twists and turns was like driving a race car through a twisty road where the scenery changes at every turn with an indelible impression, completely original, scary, tense, and chilling. And I usually read at a slug pace, not a fastest reader and it takes a good story to speed me up. The end was truly not seen coming and I could not put it down once I got into the story. I was definitely surprised, and the fast pace of it helped to keep me from guessing much before the twist came. I read this book in just a few days. It was a good solid psychological thriller. I would have rated it five plus stars if that was an option, so anyway, get the book. The author plays with their sanity and brings us along for the ride and a terrific story with an ending that had me holding my breath, worth reading. The only complaint is the little information on story line and synopsis. There are also grammatical errors and a few occur during direct quotations by one of the characters. Another issue I had with was the title and synopsis.

Interesting book about faith, heart ache and great blessings which will draw you in as if the author is talking to a dear friend. The life story is an amazing journey that not only tells the good work done by the author, but also what the author went through. Imagine the surprise when I picked the up, I started reading and did not put it down again until I was done. The story is about the amazing, healing and restoring God the author serves. She encourages the reader to look beyond the current circumstances of their situation, in the good times and bad, and see how God ability is working through them, an amazing journey to the place the author is today. The author has done a wonderful work in Peru. The book made me want to sell everything and fulfill my dream of being a medical missionary. It is a good reminder that God will use us, no matter our imperfections and lacks. The message this book holds is worth the reading, and I am praying that God will inspire more of us to answer his call, no matter what your background and the struggles you might have. Having gone through abuse as the author grew up, her experience of what she went through made me keep a open heart and let the Lord use us where he needs. He will take the broken pieces of your life and be able to use them for his glory and help you to minister to others. All the proceeds from this book go directly to the orphanage and school. The author has completely dedicated herself to bringing the vision God gave her to life. She is hard working and self giving person. I appreciate author honesty and vulnerability in sharing so much personal info, having allowed God to work his plan through her and help so many suffering people. The author heart and willingness to help others will profoundly challenge you in your own walk with God. I encourage this book to everyone. You will find it to be an inspiring and awesome read. The message this book holds is worth the reading.

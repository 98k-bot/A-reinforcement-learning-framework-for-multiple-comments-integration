Every one who loves poetry should read these poems. Beautiful poems by talented native American poet and this book is in response to the apology issued by the US government to the native Americans. This deeply moving and humane poet brings history together from amazing perspectives with beautiful language and a contemporary look in artistry. The book rearranges the English language to discuss the experiences, in response to the meaningless apology of the not so public US government issued by President Obama. The author is deftly employing a poetics of fracture, erasure, and obscuration toward attacking the innumerable and woefully ongoing lies or betrayals by lyrical indictment of oppressive legalese, absolutely astonishing in rigor and ingenuity. The artful use of space in each poem creates breath and meaning like the sound on page. The poetry written by this author is biting and funny and wrenching and so thought provoking. With great moving lines, the writing style seemed constantly in motion, always shifting, never settling to interrupt the common narrative and give voice to missing history, which made a refreshing reading experience. It is worth full price and the time to read and mull the gorgeous collection. Very thought provoking, biting, funny, wrenching and inspiring, absolutely astonishing in rigor and ingenuity. This book helped me to listen immensely and become more educated on the native American point of view. Highly recommended. Truly brilliant work to be read again.

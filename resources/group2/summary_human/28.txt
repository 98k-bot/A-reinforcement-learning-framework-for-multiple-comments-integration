I eagerly purchased Provenance straight afterwards, expecting another great read, unfortunately this book is not a representative of Ann Leckie quite good skill. Although the heel of book is well pacing, yet the premise of the story is ordinary. The story felt flat, like a different author wrote it or was forced to write it, sounded like following a jealous insecure adolescent cry baby around tripping on her feet. There were actually hints of deeper ideas, but none of these interesting hints find fruition. The story has the same universe as the Ancillary justice series, but the scope got smaller. The author keeps throwing in new and boring plot twists, but it is not clear how all these coincidences keep happening. Key details seem missing. There is no some kind of AI presence, none of these really interesting hints find fruition, maybe there are more books coming. Different human races were confusing to keep separate and relationships between the cultures is unclear, just like a political thriller. None of the characters are particularly well formed and most pursue needlessly convoluted undertakings that are generally motivated by perceived emotional slights. The main character is not particularly interesting. The supporting characters are straight out of creative writing assignment from a freshman. Most pursue needlessly convoluted undertakings, motivated by perceived emotional slights. Reading the gender neutral pronouns is annoying like a gimmick. I am honestly puzzled at the good reviews. What is actually good about this book. When the writer decides to be cute by the incessant use of regular words, it becomes impossible to read which totally destroys the ability to maintain a sense of continuity for a reader over sixty years. I had to abandon this novel after a while. I was intrigued by the theme of vestiges which drove me crazy. Severely disappointed for this plot device.

This timely book reflects immigration problems from a woman viewpoint and narrow minded attitude of today political climate, an excellent representation of hard times of present Chinese citizens. The protagonist whose family has been pushed into poverty by civil unrest in her native China, is suddenly forced by fate to marry a complete stranger. It is also a book I immensely enjoy after a fast and fascinating read, a story reveals the complexity of being human. It holds my attention throughout. I was enthralled by this book for doing a good job with writing. The author sets the mood with sweet descriptions to put words together, with the talented gift for taking historical events with texture, depth, and heart. The compelling plot is about the plight of harrowing Chinese immigrants, who come to US with different reasons and struggling to succeed with courage, finally finding their way in the new world. Character development or settings as well as the story line are interesting and vivid. The characters have stayed with me long after I first read the book. I disagree with the negative reviews. They almost kept me from reading. I recommend this book for club reading due to its relativity to current immigration concerns. The determination of many Chinese to better themselves, study hard, work endlessly and live the dream became reality. The author respect for doing a good job with her writing should be appreciated. I believe that the author would do due diligence before putting a book in public eye. Highly recommended. Beautifully written and a tribute to so many. Thank you for next great story.

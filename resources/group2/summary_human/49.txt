The author has compiled a cast of all the typical, cliche, characters one would find in a variety of fiction stories. The story was fun but not enough to really care about the characters. A group of mismatched friends go on a string of adventures together. Several adventures are included in this first book but the action does not stop there, since characters must learn who is behind all the problems facing Ravenford. Along the way they build friendships and test their mettle against a number of evil creatures. The book definitely held my attention to the end and had everything that I look for, in a well written fantasy. The book also has magic, excellent battles without all the explanation fluff, a plot with pacing, a creative and well developed world, characters that are likable and grow over time with the story, good dialogue, and even a good dash of humor. The ending is most satisfying and wraps up what needs to be wrapped. The author does a great job of going beyond the usual stereotypes you see in the fantasy genre to make unique and engaging characters. I also appreciated the healthy dose of sarcasm and I am already looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Saying all that, it was a fun read, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something light to escape the trials of real life. I proof read for other authors, I love how the story flows and how you introduced characters and treasures along the way, it is a joy for your readers. However, two factors can be considered a kill joy. The first is that author constantly flashed back to explain why a character could perform some action, which we were not previously told the character could perform. The second is that author used myriads of small details and these details did nothing but prolonged the length of the story, and made the story unnecessarily too long.

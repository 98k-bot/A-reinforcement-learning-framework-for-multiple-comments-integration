This book involves dragons, forbidden magic, and romance with everything I needed in a epic fantasy and more. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end, no situation where you are endlessly waiting for the next book. Just really marvelous stuff and I was charmed. The whole story is there, no waiting for sequels. Five stars for the book contents. This book was epic with magical characters and interesting plot twists. I appreciated that the book had a variety of strong female and male characters as well as a variety of love relationships to include a gay couple and lesbian couple.

I was so excited to read an early excerpt, which in turn got me so thrilled to read the entire book.

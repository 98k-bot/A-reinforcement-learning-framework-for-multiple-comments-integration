I read the series in about three days when I had a lot of downtime and needed something to occupy me and this was great. I like fiction grounded in science but the author allowed himself too much freedom so the story becomes unbelievable. There may be a good story buried in here but it was too hard to get by the gross technical errors and there were many more. A plot line is so fantastical to beggar belief, unnecessary inaccuracies, events that simply would not happen. There are some flaws and the first flaw is that, if you look at the cover, you can anticipate a lot of the story. The second is that the ending is fairy tale and everything works out, up until the ending, the book moved along well with events making sense as they unfolded. Although I am pretty open minded, especially in the science fiction genre, yet he writing is elementary and story is uninspired, scattered and unfinished. Character development and dialogue more cliche than the most played action movie you have ever seen. Very poorly and elementary written finally to finish all off, all the good guys miraculously survive, the baddest guy disappears and of course we all have a good laugh about it. The ending feels like the author ran out of time and a bunch of things happened quickly. The dialog is laughably bad and cliche. The story was too disjointed and the characters one dimensional. Plus the text is filled with lots of bizarrely retrograde assumptions. Shortly after reading this passage I put the book down for good and I give up. I kept on thinking that all the author needed was a better friend to vet the technology sequences. This is clearly a mindless read money grab built to sell the sequels. I simply can not believe the amount of good reviews on here. Probably will not recommend it to friends or read it a second time.

I liked the two characters even if they are not developed in depth, a romantic stretch. Julia and Nate wake up hungover in a Las Vegas hotel without a whole lot of memory of the night before, confusing flashbacks. Basically you have two people who have nothing in common other than they are hot for each others bodies and they get absolutely wasted and ensue. Then they set out on an amusing journey retracting the answers with the help of friends. They do not know where to even start to work on getting the marriage annulled. I love the generic guy Nate, a divorce lawyer, though not that pleasant, with pretty body and nice tackle, who takes more than money. He has intelligence and interests with the redeeming qualities in personality. The inner dialogue of Julia is hilarious with a sense of humor. However, what did not work was the character development. There was very little info on the main characters. Except the breakup in last year, the back story are unfinished and there were too many references to things that people who did not know, no mention of parents or sibling, difficult to emotionally connect and the secondary characters were strange. It did fall a little flat. The reviews are not all real, some people are pathetically beyond easy to please since most of the reviews ranted about how funny this book was. The description flow was extremely choppy throughout the book. The writing seems juvenile otherwise. There were some funny, sexy, soft porn moments, a bit witty, fast paced screwball and even a dash of drama, although it may detract the the point of romance novels, yet all mixed well together. Not a bad read. Recommend if you are looking for a lite fun. You could not keep up with the story line.

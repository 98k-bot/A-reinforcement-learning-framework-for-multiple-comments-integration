This book is an easy read and could be used as a daily meditation of the sheer awesomeness of God. Each story is a glimpse of how involved God wants to be in your life. The first part of the book are insightful stories of miracle people have shared to increase your faith, and the second half is a kind of devotional with encouraging reminders. I was going through a difficult time with my son, so I started reading. The God started blessing and giving me strength and peace that everything was going to work out. There are also some pretty impressive stories. These short little stories are so good for the soul, remembering that God is still in the miracle business today. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, and my faith has been boosted. And I highly recommend putting into practice the principles and concepts taught in this book. The authors cares enough about each one of us who read this book to give us instructions for our prayer life and our relationship with the Father, approaching our creator. Thank you Adam for writing such a powerful book, my faith has been boosted, awesome. Thank you for sharing, these are exactly what our soul needs when we feel like we have been forgotten, best medicine yet.

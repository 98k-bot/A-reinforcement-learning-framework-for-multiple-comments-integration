This is a interesting and realistic WWII historical fiction in England, full of unconditional and sacrificial love, that grips your attention at its best. It gives a unique and dramatic insight into European that many countries are invaded and bombed. It is important that everyone remembers the suffering and struggles of those heroes both fighting and left behind during the war. I was intrigued by the main character Elenor, who has only been shown love for a brief period before her mother died, with the similarity to the orphan, she is thrown into situations to live with her mean twin brothers and ill maternal aunt, as a maid. She does not understand or cannot comprehend when life is turned around in all areas but ultimately she made the correct decision to run the farm while her brothers fought in the war. Characters are well developed and drawn without an excess of words, some may be loved, hated or despised, but none are forgettable. Although, from the title, you know there is some secret about Elenor, yet what the secret was really did not become completely clear until the end of the book. Four stars is for the story line without any back story on Elenor parents. The parents are spies and endangered the orphan, not thoroughly explained. Although there is a out of left field surprise, it does not make sense with the rest of the book. I highly recommend this must read historical novel with romance buffs, a page turner. It is a memorable story of resilience and growth with unexpected twists and turns, love and losses. The author is a gifted writer with dedication to historical accuracy. It is worth reading and I look forward to some of author other books. More editing is expected to reduce misplaced modifiers and missing punctuation, however, it did not detract from the captivating plot and story. An enjoyable reading throughout the book, evidently a wonderful work with every aspect.

I do not enjoy this book in real life. The writer is a party planner, so I would think she might have thrown a bit more dirt. The story is well written when it is about the party planning aspect but everything is just too predicable and descriptive. I do not need to read about work drama. It is nothing new, naive girl, wicked boss and handsome stranger. If you are in to anything celebrity, you might find this more interesting than people magazine. I love Rachel Hollis but this book is the epitome of cheesy and obvious. I skipped over a lot of inner monologue because I could not take the optimism. The book was left with cliffhangers. The main characters of these books are insufferable. I loved the supporting characters better. They need flaws to see supporting characters for who they are. I did not find Landon or any of the other characters to be very likable. In Landon case it makes her clown like stupid. In Max case it makes her laughably rude to everyone in her life, in reality no one would be around her. Nothing that will stick with you. No depth to characters and the plot was jumpy and I could never really get into it. I think the one thing the bugs the hell out of me is how stereotypical Landon is to what other people perceive Texans. I started out reading the book when I needed to do chores and figured I would listen to the audio book. This story could have read much better if it was just a bit more sophisticated. Yet Hollis has Landon cry like a weakling at the slightest obstacle and take to her bed for an entire tear soaked week. Hollis wants us to regard Landon as extraordinarily talented. I barely knew what to make of her most of the time. No more fiction, stick to the self help sector. I have not idea how this book got such good reviews.

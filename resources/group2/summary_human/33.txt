Be careful, this copy says it is the original edition that we all know and love but it is not the same as the original and I do not know about the one. I was expecting it to be the same as my 1970 version. Someone personalized this bootleg copy and uploaded it as if it were the original, and gave no indication that they did this in the book description and I feel like they stole money from me and am pissed. This is not what I expected, shame on whoever did this. The pages which are photocopied were cut improperly and so the letters slant at an angle across the page. I could not believe it when I opened this up and found how terrible that letters are, even not straight across the page. Front book jacket got stuck to the first page. Lovely color illustrations, yet with tiny thumbnails at the beginning or end of each section, have been taken, made as black and white and reduced to about half size. You can hardly tell what the pictures are portraying. Books too need to become real for children and that experience does not translate well for this story. I prefer my tattered, stained, paper version which has become real through generational reads. It is an unfortunate truth that today kids are conditioned to have more than just their imaginations for reference. It is nice to have a copy of the original edition for my library. This book is useless as the gift for which I purchased it. Can not rate lower than one star or I would. It does not look like a professionally printed book and there is no publisher. When we listened to CD, it was too fast. The woman that read the book did not try enough to tell the story to very young children, to understand and have enough silent time to imagine the picture. It is like the narrator wanted to finish reading as soon as possible. And sometime she laugh in a content that no reason to laugh.

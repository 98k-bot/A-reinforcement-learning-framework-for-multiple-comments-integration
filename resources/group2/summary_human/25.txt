Book had interesting information, but was in need of a good editor. It tells a history of the environmental exploitation and damage of the Gulf which started off as a history, but quickly became just an description of the environmental status of the gulf, as an environmental call. I found the book interesting in early chapters but so tedious and boring in others that I had to put it down. Without much interesting stuff, it did not make the past the first one hundred pages. The first chapter calls you to partake in essential and dangle bare feet off the edge of a weather grayed dock, then the remaining is meaningless. The vital connection linking humankind, nature, and history, turns out to be mainly humankind, then history, then nature has been affected. I wish it were the reverse of that. I just started skimming about halfway through. The subject is compelling and deserves attention, but the prose comes across as tortured. With serious trouble to get into the book, the author seems more interested in people who have been the Gulf. Writing about the natural elements is entirely through the eyes of people and descriptions of the natural world are always interrupted by anecdotes. The writing style pervades the book, a straightforward subject verb object type of sentence is preferable. Even so, there is validity in making the case that we can and must to repair the damage humankind has rendered. The book can easily be pruned in half, leaving room for actual history it advertises. I am surprised by the number of positive reviews. Honestly, this book could have been half the length and in almost every chapter, about halfway through I just started skimming and this book.

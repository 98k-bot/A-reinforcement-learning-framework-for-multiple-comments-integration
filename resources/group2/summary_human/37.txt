This is an interesting story that is poorly told and adult memoirs generally are from a point of some reflection on past events. Really liked the different view into the wartime and I thought the whole book was extremely drawn out with some details that were less than interesting but the idea of suffering was, at some times, a little hard to take. I found this book shallow, extremely drawn out with details that were less than interesting. It is a self serving memoir of a rich girl successful life to marry a millionaire, an attention grab for her perceived suffering. I feel no admiration for this family who seemed to feel entitled. Insulated from most of the war, the family had to survive with the help of wealthy connections and family. I am amazed the author had the audacity to write about their tragic hardships such as not having a cook, housekeeper, or the upscale accommodations she was accustomed to. I really have a difficult time assessing this lady story and perhaps it is prejudice against Germans of that era and my feelings that the ongoing terror in their country is not more than a few footnotes. I still feel that she still got through in fairly good form and were more than fortunate to survive and prosper. To compare this book to any story of the hardships suffered during WWII is an insult to the millions who actually did suffer. Do not be misled. I did not get much appreciation for the misery and struggle that went on. There is nothing more than thinly disguised complaining about travel delays. The self satisfied and self focus took away from the totality for me. Do not waste your time and money, unless you enjoy reading about privileged rich people problems and get another book. The writing style is like a dull day at the park, or reading a a personal diary than a book. Three stars is generous.

What was the Pulitzer Group thinking, based on the Pulitzer designation and based on some of the endorsements from favorite writers, my book club chose this book and all of us disliked it, suffered through it for my book club, could not wait for it to be over, just a dumb book. Why would a work like this get the prize, not sure how this book got great reviews. It is the story of a sap who has the misfortune of having a poor love life. The criticisms were that the main character was uninteresting, unsympathetic and not relatable. The paltry humor was only mildly amusing, not hysterical as one endorsement said. Characters were not deep enough or real enough, writing was not amazing enough. Although the episodic travel gimmick might have seemed like an interesting hook, it never stops feeling gimmicky. I spent so much energy slogging through the writer attempts to be clever in every single sentence that I could not get involved with the character or story. The book seemed to be one gay sexual reference after another. I really could care less about the boring self absorption of protagonist. A neurotic gay man to whom nothing really interesting happens, and who spends an inordinate amount of time lamenting the loss of a former partner. The book seemed to be one gay sexual reference after another, and I could not find much more to it. The ending was mechanically predictable and anticlimactic. The last line was one of the worst last lines of any book I have ever read. Overall it was tedious, difficult reading. The only redeeming aspect was the interesting way to weave past and present together in the narrative. Really disappointing.

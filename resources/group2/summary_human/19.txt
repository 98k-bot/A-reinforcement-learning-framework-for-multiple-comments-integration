A really nice reminder of the fact that life is in our control to change although it is absolutely hard. Sometimes honesty may not be the best policy and white lies and secrets seem to rule our lives. Each of the various situations, for any combination or even all of them, can and do happen in real life. However, there are many causes for the situations well as many solutions. I have been through many of the things the main character in this story was experiencing. The characters in this book are so well written, believable and complex, well developed and lifted off the pages. My emotions were taken for a ride complete with ups and downs, bumpy roads, sarcasm, twists and turns. For the plot, it ran downhill to a predictable happy conclusion. Everything was buttoned up as a simple life. Throughout the story, the author offers a piercing, and even humorous at times, look behind the curtain of marriage, with glorious spots. The first five pages alone were terrifyingly relatable. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Strongly recommend this read to anyone struggling with being stuck in life. All in all, a good tale and well told. I found myself thinking about this book even when I was not reading it, hard to put down.

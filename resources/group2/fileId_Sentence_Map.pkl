p1154
aS'This book is well written yet it lacks any substantial point and it is an example of the current trend in writing to develop intricate characters and ignore the back story.'
p1155
aS'The reason why the Hunger Games does not develop the back story of the political system and upheaval that created, it is not because the author was trying to craft edgy dystopian fiction.'

p1344

p1345
aS'Which leads me to all of the criticism about Grey, did you honesty think he was a well put together, stable, rock solid, well adjusted man with no issues.'
p1346

p1347
aS'Did you not read FSOG, if you did, we were reading totally different versions.'
p1348

p1425

p1426

p1429
aS'And the corporal punishment system the world runs on, and the author subsequently argues for is bizarre and relatively stone age compared to the futuristic setting.'
p1430
aS'None the less, it was worth reading to look at the universe this book exists in, and if the voice of the political system was made more apart of the story setting, rather then an annoying one sided debate in your ear, it would have gotten more stars.'

p1750
aS'I read it in measured doses, partly because the science stuff such relativity issues, environmental effects, gave me a headache, but especially because the emotional results of violence, hatred, bigotry, and disease were so detailed that it was hard to take all at once, anyway worth the trouble.'

p1768
aS'This is why I give it a four star rating instead of five stars and the real loser here is Card because so many readers will give up on the book before getting into it, guaranteeing that they will never get to the next books in the series.'

aS'For all its awards, I found this book disappointing and there is no insight, just the mental gymnastics of making up extensive dialog and some characters to flesh out the lives of several others.'
p1794

aS'The basic premise is that one physical city has been divided into two political cities where the citizens of each are banned by law, under penalty of death, from recognizing, acknowledging, interacting with, or seeing the citizens, cars, buildings, or landmarks of the other, is more than a bit contrived and forced at the outset.'
p1908
aS'By half way through this book, it was intensely annoying, so much so that, if there is a clever twist or denouement at the end, I will never read it.'
p1909
aS'I can not remember the last time I abandoned a book, but after struggling through fifty pages I threw in the towel and my wife was tougher and she did seventy pages.'

p1913
aS'But the book was just too boring, overly complicated, and the constant banging on the science fiction bomb was pointless and seemed to compensate for a lack of quality writing.'
p1914
aS'I tried hard to find some kind of allegory here with the modern world, alienation, the unknowable other, but even as I staggered to the end and I did finish, I just did not care anymore about all that.'

p1922
aS'Frankly, if each is taken as a separate story, I would not rate it as high, however if the series is read in order, the character development is excellent and the back stories that are hinted at in each succeeding book, are understood by the reader, making the stories much more enjoyable.'
p1923
aS'However, the advantage of this process for the author is that you end up purchasing all the books and then trying to figure out what the order should be by reading a chapter or two.'
p1924
aS'Granted that the Fleet of Worlds series do have indicators as to Book one through Book five.'
p1925
aS'However, the Book five, Fate of Worlds, really requires reading all of the Ringworld series to be best appreciated.'

aS'Look, this is by far one of the best scientific fiction books ever, the book was published in October 1970, so it was written prior to the old times.'
p1927
aS'It has by far one of the most originals ideas about a foreign world and grandiosity of engineering accomplishments, such is that this book generated a trilogy, due to its amazing story line.'

p1931
aS'The characters are well developed and complex and the main characters, two aliens and two humans are played against each other which makes for a fast paced and interesting read.'
p1932
aS'I will not elaborate on the plot any further as it will ruin it for you but I will say this, the author has said he has completed the story to the end, however, there is plenty of room for an exciting sequel for which I would stand in line to get as copy.'

aS'At times you will relate or understand but more often you just go interesting.'

p1946
aS'It is a light, easy read bonus and I love pointing out to my kids the idea for a Ring in a science fiction setting is not an original idea to the game Halo, does that make me a bad person.'
p1947
aS'Overall I enjoyed this book enough to give it five stars and the rapport between the characters was entertaining, and the concepts were extremely imaginative and mind blowing.'
p1948
aS'But there is something that just feels hollow and synthetic about the story and it seemed to be somewhat too self aware and lacked an emotional core.'
p1949
aS'Also, some of the descriptions were quite difficult to imagine, and the action was consequently hard to follow at times, but the overall scope and concepts involved is enough to recommend it to others.'
p1950
aS'I somehow made my side splits writing this but do not remove since this is a genuine review.'
p1951
aS'The book is also pretty good that the storytelling of this author feels a little, even a lot, stretched sometime, and his characters can be pretty okay.'
p1952
aS'But nonetheless filled with imaginative landscapes, cities, lost alien races, discoveries about the source of humanity, and sex with almost every single alien female we meet in this book.'

p1956
aS'After years of forgoing science fiction for more contemporary books, I was transported back to the old times and all the wonders of Ringword.'
p1957
aS'Although it was not as sleep inducing as War of the Worlds it is still excessively dry, overall the book is not bad, but I can not recommend an audible version if you are going to be driving while listening to it.'
p1958
aS'Also, some of the science of the book has not held up well over the decades, hardly surprising considering how few science fiction works have not had the problem, but it does create some jarring moments of reality.'

p1982
aS'Diamond Age is a collection of interesting ideas played out by sketchbook characters swimming in story soup that never really tightens up into a coherent plot and better than your average pulp but not as good as the later work of Stephenson.'

p1994
aS'The last quarter of the novel was about as enjoyable as the final five miles of a marathon, painful to the point of collapse, with every nerve in your body screaming to just give it up, but after making it that far you would feel foolish for not getting to the finish line, so I did, not recommended at all.'

p1997
aS'The whole idea of the book is intriguing, but the editor, not to mention the author, should be shot for making the reader slog through pages and pages of dense techno babble that the author completely made up for his future staged book.'
p1998
aS'Even if I could forgive that, the story jumps around a lot, and is very slow and I can see how it may all come together at some point all the stories of characters but dang, it takes this author forever to get there, so long, in fact, I simply gave up.'

p2002
aS'What started off as an interesting premise ends in the poor execution of a story line that starts to push the limits of my ability to suspend disbelief, particularly the story surrounding the Drummers, where the main character is taken prisoner for years and becomes part of some kind of collective consciousness supercomputer and becomes quite boring as the author tries to be didactic.'
p2003
aS'A large amount of space is spent in a seeming effort to educate the reader on the basic concepts of programming and that different systems can be logically equivalent, even though implemented on different hardware and with a different language like what he really wants you to get out of this book is an understanding of a Turing Machine, so much time spent on this that it is almost bizarre.'

p2656
aS'My favorite moments were whenever Joker interacted with Travis, the son of Carissa.'
p2657

p2658

aS'Then at about eighty percent or so , it took a opposite degree turn.'

p2686
aS'It felt like I was reading a different novel and not only that, but I felt like Margo actually became less developed as the story went on.'
p2687
aS'She just became so one dimensional, maybe that was the point to show how bad experiences change people.'
p2688
aS'The first half of the book was great, the rest not so much.'
p2689
aS'I really wanted to give it two and half stars since that is exactly the way I feel about it.'

p2691
aS'There were so many things that were said, and then changed throughout the story that I am not sure if they were mistakes in the writing or if it was supposed to be written like that to leave you guessing what is real and what is not.'
p2692
aS'I can not decide if the author was just rushing while writing this and did not realize her mistakes or of she is just an evil genius trying to make her readers feel as though they lost it.'
p2693
aS'There were times when she had said a certain amount of months had gone by but then the next chapter it was not that long at all.'

aS'My husband asked why I had such a strange look on my face.'
p2696
aS'I had to explain to him that I am almost done with a book, that I have been trying really hard to get into but I can not, but I also can not stop reading because it is such a messed up story that I have to see how it ends.'

aS'He asked why I could not just skip to the end and now that I finished, I can honestly say that I could have just skipped to the end and I would have been just as confused and filled with feelings.'

p2704

p2723
aS'This was a very twisty and dark read and I felt like it was quite unique and I still have questions about the character.'
p2724
aS'There are many people who will absolutely love this book, but it is not for me.'
p2725

p2728
aS'I walked away from this book appreciating the story and the ways it coincided with other books but overall shaking my head at how utterly messed up it was, so this is my reasoning for a middle of the road three star review.'
p2729
aS'I do not feel like I can recommend this book or dissuade anyone from reading it.'
p2730
aS'So you are probably asking yourself why I only gave it three and half stars, I had to ask myself the same question and the answer was not easy to find.'
p2731
aS'Because objectively, this book is awesome and the author did it all really well.'
p2732
aS'At the end, I think it just as not for me.'
p2733
aS'Part of the reason was the all consuming sadness, depression and hopelessness that wove throughout the whole story like a spiderweb you can not escape and there was too much for me.'
p2734
aS'The little, tiny sliver of hope that the story offered, might or might not have been real, which just pissed me off.'
p2735

p2818
aS'It is an interesting interpretation, but one that left me wondering about many of the other events that take place in the book.'
p2819
aS'I would have appreciated a follow up from the author explaining what in his book is real and what is fictionalized.'
p2820
aS'The book paints a horrifying picture of the brutality of slavery and its devastating impact on generations of families.'
p2821
aS'Personally, I found the second half of the book less fluid and somewhat disjointed than the first.'
p2822
aS'If you are looking for a completely accurate work of historical fiction on the topic of the Underground Railroad this is not it.'
p2823
aS'I picked this book for book club and by the looks on the faces around the table I wish I had not.'
p2824
aS'I found it an uninspired, one dimensional slog through unnecessary details of cruelty.'
p2825
aS'The main character and her relationships could have been so richly developed and her story made so much more nuanced.'
p2826
aS'Instead, they were abruptly served as fodder for the next round of cartoonist brutality.'
p2827
aS'I wanted to care about what Cora was going through because I wanted to care about Cora.'
p2828
aS'The author never gave me that opportunity and I felt click baited through a grueling, half realized train ride.'
p2829
aS'There are enough changes that I am not sure what has meant to be historically accurate and what is not that makes the more gruesome details harder to sit through.'
p2830
aS'And I still do not understand the purpose of setting this as alternative history.'
p2831
aS'But it is a very well done illumination on the lives of black people at the time, regardless of slave or free or somewhere in between, and what they had to do to survive.'
p2832
aS'I do not think I would have finished the book, or even really gotten very far in, if it were not for the book group I am in, but I am not sorry that I read it.'
p2833
aS'I think this book had a lot of hype behind it.'
p2834
aS'While it was not bad by any means, I simply in my opinion did not enjoy it.'
p2835
aS'To be fair to the author and to who ever reads this review, this post is the definition of the type of review you should ignore.'
p2836
aS'It is completely biased to my opinion on the subject of African Americans during this time, as well as the the Jim Crow South.'
p2837
aS'I personally enjoy reading more non fiction material, but realize it is important to strengthen both the left and right side of your brain, which is why i selected this fictional piece.'
p2838
aS'Overall, I read We Were Eight Years In Power right after this book and it served to be much more enjoyable, again for me.'
p2839
aS'The writing in this publication is sound, the material is enjoyable and the the reading seams to fly by, just not my cup of tea.'
p2840
aS'I saw all the great reviews of this book and was so looking forward to reading it and I was very disappointed.'
p2841
aS'This is not historical fiction, it is just some sort of historical fantasy.'
p2842
aS'It completely diminished everything that those who were part of the underground railroad went through.'
p2843
aS'Its depiction of North Carolina before the Civil War was also completely inaccurate.'
p2844
aS'I have read a lot of the reviews, and I actually think most of the people reading this book think it is historically factual.'
p2845
aS'It is such a disturbing book in so many ways, but I could get past that if it at least tried to be historically accurate.'
p2846
aS'I will say though, I loved the character Cora.'
p2847
aS'I was so routing for her, so the fantasy helped with that.'
p2848
aS'I lost interest in this book about half way through.'
p2849
aS'I thought this book had a mixed up style.'
p2850
aS'The author tried to include commentary on slavery that I found distracting and the violence included also seemed random, and not in a good way.'
p2851
aS'I thought it was cheesy in parts and, I will just go ahead and say it, Cora herself seemed boring and not all that bright, just my opinion.'
p2852
aS'People describe Cora as a strong character but she was mostly tagging along with others, first Ceasar then Royal, she said it herself, I am just a passenger.'
p2853
aS'Cora seemed surrounded by amazing, interesting people while she herself was just okay.'
p2854
aS'Quite honestly, I also found it super strange that the author chose to portray real trains underground.'
p2855
aS'So much about this book did an excellent job with very well done portal of setting and mood, only to ruin it this fantasy train thing.'
p2856
aS'That is not necessary because the network was cool enough as it was.'
p2857
aS'The upside is that I felt the author did an excellent job with the settings.'
p2858
aS'It was easy to get a feel for how it might of been to be in many of these places.'

S'I have not read science in many years, it was my passion as a teen, but I am long past that period of my life now, so I was pleasantly surprised by the writing and intellectual quality of The Forever War.'
p2861
aS'It is a provocative novel that uses the Theory of Relativity to show us how much the world changes over the one hundreds of years that actually pass while the space warriors are on missions that last for months.'
p2862
aS'Shifts in social and sexual mores that occur during the protagonist three combat missions are jarring for him, yet he manages to hold to his personal principles and beliefs.'
p2863
aS'The parallels with Vietnam are clearly intentional, since the author fought in Vietnam, and the returning soldiers are greeted not as heroes but as oddities in a culture that has war and made peace with an enemy that had slaughtered many of the men and women friends.'
p2864
aS'This novel is the kind of thoughtful science fiction that I used to love, and I am delighted to know that such books are still being written, bring on more.'
p2865
aS'It is certainly a good book and I enjoyed reading it, however, I think that it has lost something since being written.'
p2866
aS'Maybe its tremendous impact on the science fiction genre is working against it when read today.'
p2867
aS'Specifically, the concepts which were novel when this was written, have become science fiction tropes and standards, which since have executed with greater breadth and resolution.'
p2868
aS'The length of this book also works against it in that it is hard to flush out concepts when the time line of the book is millennium and the book is less than three hundred pages.'
p2869
aS'I am not sure it is fair to criticize the odd anachronistic future technology already surpassed today, but it was somewhat jarring at times.'
p2870
aS'For all the criticism I have, it is absolutely a required read for any lover of science fiction.'
p2871
aS'It is one of the corner stones that the modern genre is built on and an enjoyable read.'
p2872
aS'One of the finest novels to be written in the wake of the Vietnam War and probably the best military science fiction novel ever written, The forever war is one conscripted the journey of solider through space and time as he fights a mysterious enemy and is pressed further and further into a faceless military machine.'
p2873
aS'The author served as an army engineer in Vietnam and based the story on the letters he wrote home to his wife.'
p2874
aS'This is probably what gives the book, though abounding in page turning battles, its remarkably human touch.'
p2875
aS'Forever War, written in the terse prose, is as masculine as it is tender and heartbreaking.'
p2876
aS'It shows not only a gritty experience of war of a solider but also his inability to escape it upon returning home.'
p2877
aS'This one deserves to be read by every self respecting science fiction fan, even ones that are not into military fiction.'
p2878
aS'William Mandella has been drafted into a war against an alien race.'
p2879
aS'Not only does he worry about facing the alien race, but he also has to deal with the fact that space travel has him fighting for an Earth that he dose not even know anymore.'
p2880
aS'This is truly a unique novel.'
p2881
aS'I have never read anything like it, so if you are looking for something completely different I highly recommend picking this up.'
p2882
aS'The isolation, despair and fear fully come through in the writing, making the reader care instantly what happens to Mandella.'
p2883
aS'The only slight issue I had with the book was the choppiness of the narrative.'
p2884
aS'I am assuming this is supposed to give the reader a sense of the disconnect Mandella has with others because of the time travel, but it did make it so the story felt at times incomplete.'
p2885
aS'War in space with all the time dilation to worry about and what it is like to come home during a war that seems to last forever.'
p2886
aS'The individual that the story is focused on starts out as a drafted private, even though he is a College educated individual.'
p2887
aS'It seems that for the purposes of fighting a ground war in an alien environment, education is considered a plus not a minus in the infantry.'
p2888
aS'As time goes on, fairly little for him, but a great amount for the world he is from earth, he goes up in rank and has to deal with things that change around him.'
p2889
aS'While not a deep look at the problems involved in understanding the world and his changing place in it, it is a very well written and thought provoking book.'
p2890
aS'The ending is almost classic.'
p2891
aS'I can not quite figure out why it is listed as the first book in the Forever War, since the ending wraps it up quite nicely.'
p2892
aS'It has been awhile since I had read classic science fiction story so since this one went on sale I picked it up.'
p2893
aS'I would heard of the book but it never read it before hand I was surprised that some of the transitions that took place during the time lines.'
p2894
aS'It should not be a surprise that this book is symbolically about the Vietnam War even though it takes place in the future.'
p2895
aS'I found it interesting how some of the concepts of the future are actually beginning to materialize now such as the acceptance of homosexuality.'
p2896
aS'I hope to read more works of this author as soon as I get through some of the others ahead of his in my library.'
p2897
aS'The title is appropriate since the book covers several hundred years although it does not cover them in a drawn out manner.'
p2898
aS'The Forever War is a good book but shows its age a little.'
p2899
aS'One can tell the Vietnam War, population growth and the sexual revolution of the sixties were fresh on the mind of the author.'
p2900
aS'This notwithstanding, it is still a fine and engaging science fiction novel.'
p2901
aS'It covers a lot of ground, spanning one the life of the man over centuries, which is both interesting but also a little frustrating.'
p2902
aS'Each stop in a different era hints at interesting societal situations that go relatively unexplored as the protagonist catapults forward to the next era.'
p2903
aS'A stop in a future United States so rife with violence and crime that everyone ventures out armed to the teeth never felt real to me, nor did the decision of humanity to jettison heterosexuality in order to control population.'
p2904
aS'But, if you do not mind a book that raises more questions than it answers, this is an interesting use of the science fiction genre to explore topics of war and the inclination of this man towards violence.'
p2905
aS'Oldie but great, borne from his experience in Vietnam, flavored by scientific rigor, and embellished with a gifted storyteller art, this novel on conducting interstellar war without warp drive is fascinating even many years later.'
p2906
aS'And the focus is on the human element, what if you had a time machine that only goes forward.'
p2907
aS'And every time you get off the world has completely changed, mores, language, even sexual orientation.'
p2908
aS'And you are distanced from the person you love, not by miles but by centuries.'
p2909
aS'And you work with people born three hundred years after you, winner of every major science fiction award.'
p2910
aS'I can strongly recommend this novel if you enjoy sf or military or just good writing.'
p2911
aS'I went into this book with very high expectations and anyone I knew who had read it said it was one of the best science fiction books they had read.'
p2912
aS'The reviews were raving and the read is very quick and you can get through it in a day if you have the time and the desire.'
p2913
aS'It is also a fun read, in that it is both easy and gives a little brain tease semi regularly.'
p2914
aS'However, it did not live up to the very high expectations I had.'
p2915
aS'I would not put it in the top books I have ever read.'
p2916
aS'I still give it five stars because I really enjoyed it and I am glad I read it.'
p2917
aS'And I probably would not have been so critical if I went into it blind.'
p2918
aS'This is probably one of my favorite science fiction books currently.'
p2919
aS'I found myself going back and rereading the ending multiple times.'
p2920
aS'I will not give anything away suffice to say that the different eras that the main character enters due to time dilation from traveling at near light speed was very interesting.'
p2921
aS'The combat in the book is well written and keeps you interested.'
p2922
aS'The aliens in the book truly seem alien and do not seem to be your humans in a mask kind of aliens which is quite refreshing.'

S'Interesting at the beginning but within first fifty pages I got lost, did not know which direction the story was going.'
p2926
aS'The novel has some interesting chapters scattered in between the main story but I got disappointed that they turned out to be independent stories with no connection to the main story.'
p2927
aS'Some of the description of the so called gods, their clothing, their looks and the dietary habits was nauseating.'
p2928
aS'Because of so many rave reviews I completed the novel and the question that I had in my mind what is the point remained unanswered.'
p2929
aS'If you ever have a chance to listen to a Neil Gaiman book on audio, do it.'
p2930
aS'I believe he narrates several of his audio books and he is a velvety voiced reading god.'
p2931
aS'Beyond the stellar narration, the story was just so so.'
p2932
aS'I started reading it last year and quickly grew bored, so I stopped.'
p2933
aS'Then I decided to give it another go when I found the audio version with Gaiman reading.'
p2934
aS'His voice and inflections give the story a little punch, but not enough to make up for all the elements I felt this novel lacked.'
p2935
aS'This is a book that started off as a short story and was expanded into a novel, and you can tell.'
p2936
aS'For me, it still sits somewhere in between a short story and a full blown novel, and I thought it could have used some more expanding and exploring of the characters, most of whom felt never fully realized.'
p2937
aS'Still, the narration of Gaiman merits an extra star, and I did enjoy letting him read to me.'
p2938
aS'I realize this book was an award winner and many people enjoyed it.'
p2939
aS'I liked the concept but Gaiman did not make me care enough about the characters or the coming war to draw me in.'
p2940
aS'There was probably about two month gap between my reading the bulk of the book and the last few chapters.'
p2941
aS'The gods are much more exciting and engaging in their legends and myths than they were in this novel.'
p2942
aS'I felt the writing was very articulate, but not too high brow.'
p2943
aS'It was very readable and the main character was a likable guy, but I felt I never really knew him.'
p2944
aS'The defining moment that happened prior to the book opening was never really explained.'
p2945
aS'Overall I felt like there was no middle to the story.'
p2946
aS'You just meandered along trying to figure things out and then it is the finale, even the finale was anti climactic.'
p2947
aS'I am not really sure what happened and I could see how this might be a compelling TV show with the visuals, but it left too much to my imagination.'
p2948
aS'It was well written and it flowed along fine, but I wanted more depth.'
p2949
aS'Since this is such a classic by Gaiman, I kept expecting the book to grip me and envelop me in the imagination of Gaiman.'
p2950
aS'Unfortunately, that moment never quite arrived for me.'
p2951
aS'While Gaiman is definitely a master of prose, and his writing reflects a fertile imagination, I never became emotionally involved with either the story or the characters.'
p2952
aS'However, considering the underlying theme of the American tendencies for passing religious affiliation to various fads, perhaps Gaiman achieved his goal and offered me the atmosphere created by a world of fickle populism.'
p2953
aS'Well, the writing was excellent and there were lots of fascinating ideas and observations about life and how societies function, and there were some nice plots turns and twists, but it did require a bit of effort to continue on with the story.'
p2954
aS'I struggled to care about the characters.'
p2955
aS'They always seemed interesting but perhaps more chess pieces than as people I climbed inside of and saw through their eyes.'
p2956
aS'But that said, I do not regret reading it and it does seem to be a worthwhile reflection on where the world is.'
p2957
aS'This is a fable like fantasy story about childhood that on the surface is very simple but it has more symbolism than I had the desire to wrap my head around.'
p2958
aS'I felt like every little thing likely had a meaning but I did not care to unpack it all and perhaps was not in the right mood for it.'
p2959
aS'If you are the type of reader who loves hidden meanings and contemplating symbolism you will likely adore this read, especially if you like fantasy or fairy tale like elements.'
p2960
aS'There are quite a few beautifully written and insightful lines.'
p2961
aS'It is whimsical and frightening, straight forward in its story line but complex with imagination and meaning.'
p2962
aS'I was left with questions because you only got a slight peek into this imaginary world.'
p2963
aS'With my mixed feelings, it is likely I will return to this book when I am in more of a mood for discovery and expect to enjoy it more as I slip even further from childhood.'
p2964
aS'I guess hanging out with mythical gods who apparently are not just mythical is not my cup of tea.'
p2965
aS'I read this longer, tenth anniversary edition for a book group, and my reading probably would have dragged on much longer if I did not have a book group deadline to meet.'
p2966
aS'Yep, I get it, I get the allegories, the symbolism, the war between the old gods and the new ones.'
p2967
aS'I did like the concept of what keeps the old gods viable.'
p2968
aS'I even liked the character Shadow, but the story was too long and never really drew me into it.'
p2969
aS'It has been a long time since I studied mythology but still I recognized most of the main gods.'
p2970
aS'I just did not care about them, and even their struggle to be recognized in the modern world just fell flat.'
p2971
aS'The physical settings, the descriptions were very enjoyable.'
p2972
aS'I know this book has many fans, but I was happy to finally move on to something more interesting.'
p2973
aS'This book for me is like the movie the Godfather that I know it is supposed to be good and a lot of people tell me it is good, but I just do not like it.'
p2974
aS'I am on my second reading of the book and I read it about seven years ago and I figured maybe I was just to young to understand it.'
p2975
aS'I like the character Shadow with his stoic nature, but that is about it.'
p2976
aS'The concept is interesting as well, but the concept of old world ideas coming to die in America is a fairly used up one and it is just rehashed here.'
p2977
aS'Reading this book is like walking somewhere in a cold mist and not really knowing where your going, and when you get where you are apparently supposed to be you do not know why the hell you took the trip in the first place.'
p2978
aS'Maybe I just do not get Neil Gaiman, but too each their own.'
p2979
aS'And the above review is a meanderingly and seemingly pointless as the plot of this book.'
p2980
aS'This may be an unpopular opinion, but I was severely underwhelmed by this book.'
p2981
aS'The basic story itself is good that a middle aged man returns to his hometown for a funeral and finds himself sitting at the edge of a pond remembering the life of his seven year old self.'
p2982
aS'The ideas of sacrifice and memory and growing up are interesting enough.'
p2983
aS'There was just too much unnecessary magic for me.'
p2984
aS'The beginning and the end were quite good, as were some of the in between parts.'
p2985
aS'But there were whole chunks where the magic was drawn out to unnecessary lengths.'
p2986

p2992
aS'But back to this story, I almost did not read Kellans point of view because so often when a story is one point of view and then the author decides to throw in a second point of view in a different book, it falls so flat for me.'
p2993
aS'This was not the case at all for Kellans story.'
p2994
aS'I felt like I was reading a completely different book.'
p2995
aS'Of course, it had a lot of the same scenes as the first book.'
p2996
aS'But it was written so beautifully that instead of feeling like I was watching a rerun of a movie or show.'
p2997
aS'It added to the effect and I still had the reference from the first book.'
p2998
aS'All those times I read the first book and wished I had insight to how Kellan felt, or what he was thinking.'
p2999

aS'I miss this couple so much and would read anything this author publishes for them.'
p3012

p3016
aS'Glad to say there was no sacrificing or suffering.'
p3017
aS'I really like the drama and romance and it was nice to see how Kellan felt when he said certain things.'
p3018
aS'My only disappointment with this series is that every girl that meets Kellan just finds him over the top handsome.'
p3019
aS'The great thing about humans is that our opinions are different and what one person likes another person dislikes.'
p3020
aS'For example, I personally do not find blonde, blue eyed, tall lean men attractive and I have more of a Mark preference.'
p3021
aS'With all this being said, this is a great series but in reality what one woman finds attractive does not mean another woman will feel the same.'
p3022
aS'I got to see both Kellan and Kiera in a somewhat different light.'
p3023
aS'I liked that more of Kellan childhood and his bond with Denny was included in the story and it made everything more heart wrenching for me.'
p3024
aS'It is amazing that Kellan is this sexy rock god who can have any woman he wants, yet he is so incredibly insecure.'
p3025
aS'I thought my heart would break when it was revealed why he had so many sexual encounters.'
p3026
aS'Without ruining anything, it is not for your normal reasons of numbing the pain he carried around with him.'
p3027
aS'It made me want to hold him and assure him that everything would work out for him, and he would be okay.'
p3028
aS'And Kiera, well, there were plenty of times in reading their story in earlier novels that I wanted to strangle this girl.'
p3029
aS'However, through Kellan eyes and feelings for her, I saw her a bit differently.'
p3030
aS'I could understand a little more of why she kept floundering in her decision regarding Kellan and Denny.'
p3031
aS'It also shed new light on how both of their insecurities affected them both and all the others that were in their paths.'
p3032

p3033

p3034
aS'Honestly, it was slow going for the first twenty percent but then I could not put it down.'
p3035
aS'I loved getting in the head of Kellan and I felt like it was a completely different book when you know his motives.'
p3036
aS'I loved his inner monologue and I loved knowing what he was doing when he would disappear for days in this book.'
p3037
aS'I loved knowing why he let Kiera do what she did to him as that was my biggest frustration with him in this book and the cause of many an angry text sent to fellow book club members.'
p3038
aS'Still not the biggest Kiera fan, but I feel like this book showed more growth for her than even her own book did, because Kellan forced her to grow by leaving her at the end.'
p3039

aS'It provided some insight into the inner workings of one of my favorite characters, Kellan Kyle, and it was nice to venture back to the bar of Pete and to revisit the bags and all of their craziness.'
p3055
aS'I have to start by saying that I absolutely love the this series.'
p3056
aS'The first book was told strictly from Kiera point of view, so I was anxious to read next book, the same plot, but told from Kellan point of view.'
p3057
aS'It was wonderful getting Kellan side of what happened and what he was feeling and experiencing throughout the book.'
p3058
aS'It really made me appreciate the story that much more.'
p3059
aS'I definitely recommend reading Thoughtful after reading the entire Thoughtless series.'
p3060
aS'It feels like I have been waiting forever to read the point of view of Kellan and I just hope this is not the end.'
p3061
aS'I really hope the other two books are also told from his point of view.'
p3062
aS'In this book, Kellan comes across as a jerk.'
p3063
aS'Finally knowing what was really going in his head, my heart just breaks for him.'
p3064
aS'Sometimes, I felt that if he had just told her right away that he was in love with her, then maybe they would have gotten together sooner.'
p3065
aS'However, I do not think that would have a difference because Kiera was just too absorbed with herself to really care how her actions were making other feel.'
p3066
aS'It seemed like she was just playing him even though that is not really what happened.'
p3067
aS'It was nice knowing the truth behind all the girls he was bringing home for awhile.'
p3068
aS'I did not really care much for the ending because it makes it seem like that is the end of his story when I hope that is not the case.'
p3069
aS'There are just way too many other scenes that I had always wanted to know what he was thinking.'
p3070
aS'I just hope it all comes to fruition.'
p3071
aS'I am looking forward to reading the story of Griffin because he is just too funny, but I still want more of Kellan.'
p3072
aS'I loved to hear Kellan point of view, but some of the Dialogue did not quite match up with this book.'
p3073
aS'I am not sure if I read the same book as the other reviewers, but I thought there was plenty of emotion in this book.'
p3074
aS'Of course it was repetitive, it was from the point of view of Kellan from events that took place in Thoughtless.'
p3075
aS'What did you expect, we knew what we were reading before we started reading it.'
p3076
aS'To go and give a mediocre rating based on the fact that the book was repetitive, in the past, needs to be something new is just ridiculous.'
p3077
aS'In the synopsis before you one click, it states that this is the point of view of Kellan to the events that took place in this book, if you wanted something new then you should not have read it.'

p3096
aS'There just was not enough spark and I felt like the story dragged on, not in a super boring slow paced way.'

p3098
aS'I am not sure what exactly could have upped the book.'
p3099

p3105
aS'He is exactly what you would expect the captain of a college hockey team to be and he is unapologetic about it.'
p3106
aS'On the other hand, I struggled to connect with through most of the book.'
p3107
aS'Her point of view feels like a watered down echo of Garrett, and some of her actions or reactions seem mismatched with her back story.'
p3108
aS'Regardless of my thoughts, the author kept me reading and intrigued throughout a story about hockey.'
p3109
aS'Predictable in parts, maybe, but entertaining and that is the entire point, and what moves me forward with the other books in the series.'

p3113
aS'A man who beats his wife, son and girlfriend, the victims never seek help, and no one ever notices bruises and tries to help them.'
p3114
aS'Any designated reporter would cringe when reading that.'
p3115
aS'Unfortunately, these things might happen, but I certainly would not want any one who read this to get the impression that it is not worth reporting or seeking help if they are victims.'
p3116
aS'I would have preferred to see justice prevail.'
p3117
aS'I really liked the hero in this story and my two stars go to him.'
p3118

p3119
aS'She was too silly for me, despite the suffering she had lived through before the book started.'
p3120
aS'As I did not like her, I found the romance unconvincing because I felt sorry for the hero falling for her.'
p3121
aS'I listened on Audible, after many hours, I found the voice of the narrator too husky, not a good match for me.'
p3122
aS'She narrated both the hero and points of view of the heroine.'
p3123
aS'I feel a male narrator should have spoken for the hero.'
p3124
aS'In addition, the continuing story of the friend of a hero in book two is read by the same narrator, a sample provided at the end of the deal.'
p3125
aS'As the voices were the same, it was hard to imagine that the follow up story was now about different characters.'
p3126
aS'In my opinion, different narrators should be employed to read sequels starring different protagonists.'
p3127
aS'I am sad to say, this novel was wrong for me and I will not be reading more in this series.'
p3128
aS'I was worried at the start of the book, because the heroine is a rape survivor and sadly the romance genre too often employs the rape trope for entertainment.'
p3129
aS'However, the recovery of the main character is authentic and only a subplot of the story.'
p3130
aS'I did not really like the convoluted deal from which this book takes its title that the main character reluctantly agrees to tutor Graham, captain of the hockey team, to get the football player she is crushing on to notice her.'
p3131
aS'Once the characters started having feelings for each other, though, the story picked up and I will read on in the series.'
p3132
aS'This book really interested me when I saw the raving reviews and I was super excited to start the series but unfortunately I did not fall in love with the couple which is a must for me.'

p3134
aS'The characters on their own we are great but I did not feel all gooey inside when they finally declared their feelings for one another.'
p3135
aS'I like an author who can make me miss the couple when I have to put the book down for a few minutes and the characters just did not do it for me.'
p3136
aS'It was a cute fun read and I think the author did a good job of developing the characters and there were a few parts I truly did enjoy and I laughed out loud quite a bit but that is about it.'

p3141

p3143
aS'Over time they are liking each other, making out, having sex, and professing their love for one another, again predictable.'
p3144

p3145
aS'This author is one of my go to authors when it comes to adult romance so I anticipated enjoying her hand at the new adult genre as well.'
p3146
aS'The Deal is certainly one of the better new adult novels I have read but it still did not win me over.'
p3147
aS'Regardless, I applaud this author for incorporating some pretty heavy themes into this romance and managing to keep the sexy factor strong.'
p3148
aS'Emotions were high and the drama element was in full force on both sides, but I was able to keep my eye rolls at bay.'
p3149
aS'I enjoyed this book but I do not think I will be continuing the series.'
p3150
aS'However, if you are a reader who does enjoy the new adult genre, I highly recommend this book, and because of this author, I will go ahead and recommend the rest of the series as well.'
p3151
aS'The characters were very well developed and likable.'
p3152
aS'I loved how the heroine is not too emotional about her trauma.'
p3153
aS'What she went through was serious but I do not like to listen to all the emotion of getting over it.'
p3154
aS'I like that she already got over the major humps in recovery.'
p3155
aS'The only thing I felt a little bad about was the sex.'
p3156

p3157

p3163
aS'Most movie actors are narcissists, not unlike Cole, so maybe the romance of the couple would have grabbed me more outside the context of film making.'
p3164
aS'Then again, hands down, there is a sex scene that may be one of the best I have ever read, but honestly that is about the only thing I remember about this book.'
p3165
aS'It is popular for sure, and has been made into a film, not exactly a ringing endorsement, but it droned on for too long to make its romantic point.'

aS'However, I never liked the switch between storytelling styles and it always managed to pull me from the story, an aggravation.'

p3681
aS'Beyond fifty, you have probably already learned most of the lessons in this book the hard way, however, I can see where it can be extremely helpful for a generation that spends most of its waking hours posting narcissistic fly on their cell phones.'
p3682
aS'The author gives you the blueprints to get your head out of your ass, or out of your phone, take a hard look at yourself and the real world around you, and shed many of the illusions you have been slowly poisoning your life with.'
p3683
aS'If you are a millennial, or even a disenchanted generation, pick up this book.'

p3685
aS'But, if you are over fifty, you are not going to find anything new in here except entertainment.'
p3686

p3692

p3693
aS'The tone is judgmental, rather than empathetic and the experience is cheapened by colloquialisms.'
p3694
aS'Okay, I do not want to be super critical, but I suppose that by giving this book a one star review, I am already doing that.'
p3695

p3696

p3698
aS'I have read a great number of texts that also see the merit in energy conservation but go beyond it, helping the reader to see the importance of living out their truth and working hard for what they believe in and read any yoga philosophy book for this insight.'

p3706
aS'Did not make much sense overall.'
p3707
aS'In the beginning, I felt that the author tried too hard to sound like a baby by saying fuck this and fuck that, which was entertaining and led you to believe that this might really be a different self help book unlike other ones out there in the market.'
p3708
aS'But, it really is not and I finished this book scratching my head wondering what the heck did I just read and why did I waste my time not getting anything really valuable or tangent enough to apply to real life.'

p4279
aS'Starting in the Northwest, the author trusted his life to strangers without regard to race, creed, color, or teeth to tattoos ratio, but the prospect of crossing the Mason Dixon Line made him go weak in the knees.'
p4280
aS'His reception in Kentucky was the epitome of Southern hospitality and friendliness, yet he high tailed it to the coast so fast we would not have been able to lynch him if we wanted to.'
p4281
aS'After months of travel and hardships designed to expose and dispel stereotypes, he fell victim himself to the oldest American stereotype of all, the vicious Southern redneck.'

aS'The author made all kinds of excuses and he was worn out.'
p4283
aS'His girlfriend missed him and His feet hurt, nobody was fooled.'
p4284
aS'This book was better than I anticipated, largely due to the nonjudgmental observations of the author of those he met.'
p4285
aS'He seemed to find the likable qualities in almost everyone.'
p4286
aS'It was also interesting to see how cathartic it appeared to be for strangers to tell another stranger about their past wounds as if they had been waiting for the time they could unburden themselves of their past hurts and have someone only listen and acknowledge their pain.'
p4287
aS'To me, this was a brave exhibition of human vulnerability by the author.'
p4288
aS'This book reminds us we all have carried, or are carrying, a heavy load regardless of how well some of us hide it.'

p4293
aS'The author honestly expressed the emotions he experienced interacting with these people, from fear and disgust in a few cases, to empathy, sorrow, gratitude, admiration, happiness, and even love.'
p4294
aS'The author was also open to changing his opinions as he encountered many types of people and places which he had never encountered before.'

p4296
aS'The author notes that people have their flaws and quirks himself included but that they are still capable of kindness that deeply affected him.'
p4297
aS'The book makes me to do some soul searching myself, would I have shown kindness to this hitchhiker, how much am I willing to step outside my comfort zone, how am I affected by the generosity of some of the characters who helped him even though they possessed very little.'
p4298

p4299
aS'Two years ago, I met a woman from Europe biking across penniless, yet walking and hitchhiking lends itself to more perils.'
p4300
aS'In some ways, I found it sad that so many people across our country are dealing with so many troubles, but beautiful to see so many who had so little giving what they had.'
p4301
aS'I am curious now wondering how this walk affected the life after wards of the author, how did he look at life, did he grow in his faith after meeting so many Christians, and how did it change his life, an excellent read.'
p4302
aS'I like to be inspired in a realistic way and this book did that for me.'
p4303

p4304

p4305
aS'Apparently, one can count on the kindness of strangers.'
p4306
aS'In the end, It was the Ordinaryness of events in this extraordinary journey that made this book compelling and is what encouraged me to read on as he traveled on.'
p4307

p4308
aS'Over four thousand miles later, the author has a book to write.'
p4309
aS'Traveling back roads through the best the US has to offer he finds that the people with the least to give are the ones picking the author up and allowing him to stay in backyards or spare bedrooms.'

p4311
aS'During walk of the author, he thought about marriage with his girlfriend when he stayed with people who were in love for years only to find out at the end of the trip that his girlfriend had decided she liked living alone.'

p4348
aS'Let us hope that the circus lovers have read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.'
p4349
aS'Humans are pretty bad answering such questions without triggering our slow thinking system.'
p4350
aS'So the author is exploring the limitations of our carbon based computer to measure our ignorance, worse than random.'
p4351
aS'The methodology is bad but the book gets better, reusing the own argument of this author about the world.'
p4352
aS'Then the author goes about telling interesting discussions around world facts also sharing basic applied statistics that he renamed to fact.'
p4353
aS'Things are indeed getting better in the world and maybe even teenagers around the world can already write computer programs to these fact based questions and keep us updated.'
p4354
aS'Naive and narcissistic, first the authors ask you not to trust in average values alone.'
p4355
aS'A few pages later they present only averages, without any ranges or confidence intervals, simply because it suited their preaching.'
p4356

p4357

p4359
aS'The author presented himself as such great scientist that I needed to go and see his academic publishing records.'
p4360
aS'Not very convincing, actually very modest and I started to doubt Swedish universities criteria for professorship, which should be among the highest in the world, a waste of money.'
p4361
aS'I have enjoyed and used the website that the author create, and think that is a brilliant tool to help people understand data, grasp and communicate facts.'
p4362
aS'That is one thing, and writing a whole book multiple pages long around thirteen charts, is another.'
p4363
aS'The book has no depth, there is nothing here that will make you think or reflect about anything, that would not have happened anyway by browsing and playing with the website.'
p4364
aS'The stories are superficial, the insights are so elementary, that it makes the book look like a sort of self help advice.'
p4365
aS'Great for kids, and for teenagers to help them grasp the basics of data visualizations, and get them acquainted with some facts about the world.'
p4366
aS'Nothing more and do not waste time or money here, locating this book in the thought provoking section of the bookstores is an insult to human intellect.'

aS'I read the book because I wanted to believe it.'
p4370
aS'I will keep the book because I want to refer back to it when I hear opposing claims.'
p4371

p4372
aS'It always bothers me when the reference is a web page and the date of the page is the date the page was viewed, not written.'
p4373
aS'Statistics about good news is hard to come by and that is why you should buy the book for your teenager.'
p4374
aS'The main thesis of the book that many, uncommonly known things are improving, is of marginal use at best.'
p4375
aS'One can pick almost any point in history and find a previous point where the condition was worse, as an analogy that the standard of living in Roman times was exponentially better than tribes of nomadic hunter or gatherers.'
p4376
aS'This is not a particularly useful or shocking revelation, nor does it follow that such a relationship existed between the peak of the Roman empire and the next several decades as it fell into decline.'
p4377
aS'Furthermore, by choosing to focus attention solely on specific, statistical improvements, the author precludes discussion of statistical regression or analysis of negative outcomes not measured by statistics.'
p4378
aS'Even mention of the limitations of statistical measurements get short shrift.'
p4379
aS'I did not feel these were intentional oversights, more like the result of insufficient understanding of economic systems and the cause or effect relationships involved.'

p4383
aS'It is not simple human nature that causes journalists to exaggerate and print only the worst and it is their bread and butter.'

aS'However, the authors intent to remind us all to think rather than just react is a welcome one in the social media age.'

p4386
aS'Perhaps this is a big improvement over the last couple of millennium, but it is a staggering fact taken on its own.'
p4387
aS'Most people are hungry much of the time, have scarce access to education, health care, or clean water.'

p4391
aS'The main theses of this book is that, the world is improving and is much better than what most people think.'
p4392
aS'Though in final chapters the book presents some very big risks to humanity.'
p4393
aS'Following the idea about our successful situation, the author presents a popular cognitive psychology about our inappropriate instincts that are responsible for this failure to perceive the right situation and suggests some common sense rules how to overcome these instincts.'
p4394
aS'For example, do not refer to one number, such as the number of babies death, but rather compare it with the data of previous years in order to reveal the trend.'
p4395
aS'The main drawbacks is that the book is repetitive, and includes many long stories which contribute very little to the main argument and it could be easily transformed into a short paper.'
p4396
aS'The authors make good points about poverty, global health, and global population trends, but they are hypocritical.'
p4397
aS'They are strong advocates for looking at facts and ignoring selective and exaggerated reporting, but then they liken climate change skeptics to plane crashes, toxic waste, and crazy dictators.'
p4398
aS'Predictions are not facts, but the authors think the predictions made by climate change models are facts.'
p4399
aS'There are good reasons to be skeptical of climate models, not the least of which is that they run too hot and the field of climate science has been politicized.'

p4403
aS'Our fear of numbers are a huge part of how we got into the mess that we are in.'
p4404
aS'There are moments when I am cheering Rosling on, like the concept that context matters and we can not view numbers in isolation, but the author can not seem to get out of the way of his own ego and agenda.'

p4415
aS'I am not disappointed in the book although I would have liked to read more than a few paragraphs about the current war in Afghanistan, but the book sort of left me disappointed in the American people for tolerating the current situation, in which the United States has become just like the European great powers of the eighteenth century whose example the Founders strove to avoid.'
p4416
aS'The one way in which the book could have been improved would have been with a greater focus on Eisenhower and Nixon, who ended wars they inherited even in the absence of clear victory, a skill sadly lacking in contemporary Presidents.'

p4451
aS'The author backs Johnson up, and I am still a skeptic who also feels that, despite the Great Society Johnson pushed through, yet with mostly ideas from the Vietnam War, we should put Johnson for the bottom of the list, but this is the book of the author and he has the expertise on Johnson to make his case.'

p4457

aS'The detail given really let us you feel like a fly on the wall in the midst of momentous decisions.'

aS'Even finding a true good friend is so hard these days, so how to be alone, how to brave the wilderness, I do not think so.'
p4470
aS'No help, comfort or good advice in this book, just the broad view of the author on how to deal with a world getting harder and harder to live in happily.'
p4471
aS'I bought this book because the author was interviewed on Morning News and she is impressive but the book is not.'
p4472
aS'The author writes over and over again about research but her research is investigating such nebulous terms as true belonging or integrity without presenting what researchers typically do is to define your terms objectively and measurably, undertake a scientific sample, specify your research procedures and instruments.'
p4473
aS'Consequently, this book should not be taken as social science research findings.'
p4474
aS'Some ideas seem thoughtful and reasonable but the findings are not the real research findings.'
p4475
aS'I found much of the content in this book old and stale and carefully packaged to create a surface level sense of safety.'
p4476
aS'This book implies the wilderness is a new phenomenon when in reality people of color have had to navigate all the things she describes for generations.'
p4477
aS'As a sociologist she knows this, so the book reads like she took survival strategies from people of color and watered them down for her target audience of white, middle class women and men.'
p4478
aS'The author introduces concepts like authenticity and courage from a very shallow perspective and provides tips that are often either confusing or insulting.'
p4479
aS'The author brags that she is an experienced expert in sociology yet completely avoids providing a realistic, ethnic and cultural context that reflects the society she is supposedly helping her readers navigate.'

aS'Instead, this book is about not judging others and getting politically polarized.'
p4483
aS'This book is not that I do not think those are important issues, because goodness knows they are , but that is just not what I thought I was going to be reading about.'
p4484
aS'To be fair, I only read half of the book, but after glancing through the remaining three chapters and the book looked like more of the same.'
p4485
aS'I really wanted to like this book and I have read all of past books of this author multiple times.'
p4486
aS'Each book is like eating an elephant of wonderful data and introspection, filled with life giving challenges and hope.'
p4487
aS'Each of my copies have hundreds of notes and highlights in them.'
p4488
aS'I have even taught and entire men retreat on Vulnerability, and it was wonderful.'
p4489
aS'This book though, I am not sure what mark she was trying to hit with it, but in my opinion it did not hit any mark.'
p4490
aS'Half of the book is simply other famous people stories or research proving her points, very few stories of actual participants, save one memorable one about a guy berating his father right after he promised to be kinder to him.'
p4491
aS'The rest of book is completely uncharacteristic of her depth and wisdom and feels really shallow and overly politicized.'
p4492
aS'I feel this book was rushed, the data she did not really know as well, and the point was missed.'
p4493
aS'I sense that running the four companies now that she talks about in the book have diluted the ability to really focus on life changing writing, which is her gift, in my opinion.'
p4494
aS'I will now go back and read The Gifts of Imperfection again.'
p4495
aS'This book has a strong start and my takeaway is that one needs not to be afraid to speak out and speak up the beliefs.'
p4496
aS'Speaking out can bring you to a lonely place but one would be surprised to find other people in the same situation.'
p4497
aS'As well, the author emphasizes the need to share good and bad experiences with others so as to create the emotional connection so scarce these days and the last chapter could be shorter.'
p4498
aS'It is okay and I have read all of her books and I was really looking forward to this one, but it was a disappointing, very little new material.'

aS'This one is very political and I happen to agree with her political ideology, so it did not bother me, but I was not expecting a political book.'
p4502
aS'This book is also going to date the book and her other books will stand the test of time and this one probably will not.'
p4503
aS'If you have never read any of work of this author, you will probably like this, but if you have read her other work, you will find this to be disappointing because it is not as good as Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, Gifts of Imperfection, or I Thought It Was Just Me.'
p4504
aS'I enjoyed her other books and even when I disagreed with her and her books were readable and well written.'
p4505
aS'This book is just plain awful and white guilt, political rants, weird ramblings, recycled, irrelevant research, disjointed writing.'
p4506
aS'Best I can tell this book aspires to be a guide for surviving when your political candidate loses.'
p4507
aS'That is fine, but I feel duped because I did not realize that was the direction her book was headed.'
p4508
aS'I could not finish this book and I am done with this author.'
p4509
aS'So I really liked another book The Gifts of Imperfection of this author, so naturally I thought this would be a good one.'
p4510
aS'But the whole white guilt thing at the beginning was too much and her bemoaning on about how white people would think the author is black because of her name, like, I did not even think about it until the author wrote about it.'
p4511
aS'I guess the beginning just ruined it for me and I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone.'
p4512
aS'I guess it is popular because she is obsessed with Oprah and feels bad about her white privilege.'
p4513
aS'I do not know the whole book was just way too liberal and scheduled for me to actually respect it.'
p4514
aS'I had high hopes for this book, unfortunately, what was showcased as a self help book for how to stand on your own, actually turned out to be a politically biased, opinionated novel lacking real data and facts.'
p4515
aS'I had to stop halfway in because this book simply did not resonate and the author tries to associate loneliness and not fitting in to the current political climate, with a very one sided perspective.'
p4516
aS'Most of the tangents she goes on do not even tie back to the original theme of the book.'

p4521
aS'It seems very focused on doing big things in life and most of the examples given are the same old tired people we have heard about a million times, mostly rich people, military generals and CEO.'
p4522
aS'I guess for pop culture, those examples are fitting.'
p4523
aS'I would have preferred something more introspective in tone, but that just me.'

p4531
aS'That is just not how humans work and holiday gives us instruction after instruction on how best to conduct our lives and achieve our goals.'

p4538
aS'I did quite a bit of troubleshooting, but could not correct the issue.'
p4539

aS'Bunch of platitudes, surrounded by stories of supposedly great people, though many of these people who are held up as models are only seen as admirable for the fact of having made money, a dubious qualification.'

p4543
aS'But this book tends to step into emotionally dismissive waters with some regularity.'
p4544
aS'Your problems are all in your conceiving of the situation, you should simply be able to not react with negativity.'
p4545
aS'Perhaps some of these are laudable aspirations, but the representations here suggest that achieving them is a far simpler matter than it really is for most people.'
p4546
aS'Of course, this book is probably why the book has sold well and it says what people wish was true, rather than what really is true.'
p4547

p4548
aS'The one who founded Stoicism, had some funny ideas about, say, a woman role.'
p4549
aS'You will not find any of that funniness here, instead, the book reads like politically correct motivational speaking.'
p4550
aS'More than that, the author, Ryan Holiday, has worked with folks who do positioning and manipulation as a business and they sell advice on positioning and manipulation.'
p4551
aS'Check out his wikipedia page sometime, there are lavish mentions of his work with Robert Greene, not to mention his book which is on media manipulation.'
p4552
aS'And, while the author claims to be reformed in that book, the number of five star reviews for that book that are very short and are not verified purchases, and contain nothing more than the information in the dust cover should at least give one pause, especially for a book that has serious ethical connotations.'

p4568
aS'Overall, however, there is nothing new here and I think one could go directly to the writings of the ancient stoics for the same information, particularly Marcus Aurelius who inspired this book.'
p4569
aS'Also, the ancients write extensively on virtue, the pillar of stoicism, which is sadly neglected in most modern interpretations, including this one.'

p4572
aS'I did read the whole book, and for the life of me I can not see how this book would be helpful to all of the people, organizations, and teams that apparently got so much out of it.'
p4573
aS'It is indeed full of meaningless platitudes, and to me seems to be written like too many books are, that is repeating concepts in different ways to stretch a paragraph into a page, a page into a chapter, and ultimately, a chapter into a book.'
p4574
aS'That said, so many more people like it than dislike this book and almost none of the readers feel the same as I do about the book.'

p5007
aS'Just like the former book, the author also makes a lot of provocative opinions.'
p5008
aS'The main problem with this book, is that while in a brief history of humankind each opinion is not heavily based on the former ones.'
p5009
aS'In this book the author builds up his opinions a speculation upon a speculation, and while he is a very wise person, it suffices that you would disagree with one of the assumptions for losing much of the engagement with this book.'

p5013
aS'However, I also think that the book is flawed, in its commendable efforts to make complex ideas simple and understandable, the author occasionally simplified things way too much in a way that often was self serving but I forgave all of this because of the clear enthusiasm and sense of urgency of this author.'

p5018
aS'This is an amazing book and a very thought provoking book by the author.'
p5019
aS'Very dense with many things to think about, in some ways a sequel to Sapiens, but more of a look starting recently and into the future.'
p5020
aS'The author redefines religion in terms of a widespread shared idea or commonality of view of society rather than a deity is the old way.'
p5021
aS'Thus, humanism is the religion rather than Gods, or, rather, humans and their feelings and thoughts are what is valued rather than some older idea of God.'
p5022
aS'Humanism then gets analyzed and subdivided into various types of humanism.'
p5023
aS'From there, the plot goes on to discuss how human brains may just be designed as algorithms which could in the future be out done by computers with artificial intelligence.'
p5024
aS'Also, how we are becoming more and more involved in putting huge amounts of data into computers and how this could affect the future.'

p5049
aS'This book is thought provoking, are humans truly on the path to irrelevance, is our way of life dying through our own complicity.'
p5050
aS'This is a fascinating read, but as the author says, these powerful forces are not deterministic.'
p5051
aS'Therefore, read this book within a framework of possibilities, albeit well premised ones.'

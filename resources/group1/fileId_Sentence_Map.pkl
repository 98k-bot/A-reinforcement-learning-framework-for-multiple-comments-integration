p1002
aS'However, thereafter his career fell largely into that of an itinerant orator and a newspaper editor and his speeches and prose were his life.'

p1142
aS'I do not leave many reviews, but I read a lot of books and the book is one of the most original and captivating books I have read in years.'
p1143
aS'This book has bursts of vivid imagery, macabre horrors, and addicting prose.'
p1144
aS'More akin to short fiction tied together by a thin string than an actual novel, it should not be missed by fans of horror in the vein of Neil Gaiman.'
p1145
aS'The only quibble I had was the lack of an overall plot line, while the blurb on the back of the book makes mention of one, I could not recognize one while reading the book.'
p1146
aS'Yes, a handful of the stories make mention of the Night Police but it only in passing and without great detail.'
p1147

p1151
aS'While I liked the interconnected structure, I felt that the world of the stories could have been explored more.'
p1152
aS'The stories are so short, most of them just a couple pages, that I never really felt attached to any of the people or their specific narrative.'
p1153
aS'But at the same time, each story did not seem to further the world building enough that I felt I had a full picture of this place, the timeline between characters, or the events that happened there by the time I finished the book.'
p1154
aS'Though the writing is captivating and there are some truly scary moments, I felt this narrative was just too scattered for me to really connect to it, which would have been fine if it were just a short story collection.'

p1156

p1158
aS'That is the mark of a good horror book and some of the stories, especially towards the end, were so shocking.'
p1159

p1160
aS'The story said exactly what I thought it said and David Demchuk has a wonderful way of storytelling.'
p1161
aS'It feels so real, like these stories are factual accounts of real events as the narrator experienced them really.'
p1162
aS'It is really effective way to freak me out and I will tell you what.'
p1163
aS'I highly and very highly recommend this book to all my friends who love to feel unsettled and terrified at night, the perfect Autumn read and Get it.'
p1164
aS'This is a beautiful and hauntingly written novel of David Demchuk and this book is told in a series of monologues by the inhabitants of an Eastern European town on the cusp on World War II, as well as their descendants in the modern day.'
p1165
aS'But these are no ordinary characters, many of them are supernatural beings, creatures out of folklore who live there in relative peace and prosperity, sheltered from the outside world and working at the local thimble factory.'
p1166
aS'Think the spoon river anthology of Edgar Lee Masters meets the Cabal of Clive Barker, but as World War II breaks out across Europe, a special force known as the Night Police comes for the residents of the town, persecuting them, rounding them up, and killing them.'
p1167
aS'It put me in mind of the treatment of the Jews and other so called undesirables by the Nazis, and I am sure that is no accident.'
p1168
aS'The writing of Demchuk is exquisite, as one might expect from an award winning playwright, and his imagination seems boundless.'
p1169
aS'This book is a deeply powerful and touching novel that will leave you forever changed.'
p1170
aS'This instantly became one of my favourite books of the year and I would call The Bone Mother delightful, except it was a little too terrifying for that.'
p1171
aS'Picture if you will a collection of fairy tales, the old kind which is dark and twisted, only what if they are not fantastical stories but family histories.'
p1172
aS'Maybe it is concerning the history of your family and the author delves into Eastern European folk traditions and builds something completely original.'
p1173
aS'Told as a collection of individual stories resembling fairy tales, they never quite came together as a cohesive novel.'
p1174
aS'Although perhaps that was for the best as the end result resembled an image of a secret world told to you in your dreams, fragmented and hazy but touching upon something deep and I can not urge people enough to read this one.'
p1175
aS'If we had taken time to sit at our the feet of grandmother or listened to the old men around the fire, these are the stories we might have heard.'
p1176
aS'They are most certainly the stories that come from those events after being handed down through a couple of generations.'
p1177
aS'Oppressed people do not tell tales of blithe fairies tripping through emerald forests, instead they tell of the monsters who hold them captive and devour them piece by piece.'
p1178
aS'This is a collection of those stories along with photos that will creep under your eyelids and stay there for longer than you wish.'
p1179
aS'I loved this collection not just for its darkness but also because the author has crafted it so well that it feels like one continuous story.'
p1180
aS'Each new voice continues or verifies the last one.'
p1181
aS'It is about power, greed, and evil but also about courage and family and sacrifice.'
p1182
aS'Our great grandchildren might be hearing the same kinds of stories and wondering how much courage it took to live in this time and place.'
p1183
aS'The Bone Mother was very enjoyable and dark folklore stories set in Eastern European villages and these are actually a bunch of little stories that come together to make a bigger story.'
p1184
aS'I chose to read it as a novel and it seemed to work well and each little story begins with an illustration.'
p1185
aS'What I liked about the illustrations was they set the foundation for the often creepy story.'
p1186
aS'These stories took the illustrations where I thought Miss Peregrines was going to go but did not, like I said, these stories are dark so be prepared.'
p1187
aS'At the outset this book seems to be a collection of unrelated short stories, each a uniquely unsettling and otherworldly combination of horror and folklore, but it soon becomes apparent that they are all in fact related.'
p1188
aS'The supernatural creatures that are the subject of these tales, some easily recognizable from Slavic folklore and others entirely new, each come from one of a trio of neighboring villages fighting for survival on the border of Ukraine and Romania.'
p1189
aS'This book contains stories of their struggle to survive eradication, to assimilate into modern society or face down their persecutors.'
p1190
aS'It also tells the stories of the humans who live alongside them or subject to them, the faithful, the facilitators, and the prey.'
p1191
aS'Some of these tales are ghostly and haunting, others are brutal and thoroughly disturbing.'
p1192
aS'While I enjoyed some more than others, particularly stories that featured LGBTQ characters, I love how they collectively paint a picture of an entire pocket of fictional folklore urgently telling its tales as the shadows of genocide and war loom large.'

(lp1194
S'As usual the book started off with a bang and sets up well and it seems to be written more in the Bill Hodges trilogy style, solving a crime and more mature heroes to reflect the age of the King.'
p1195
aS'In fact a character from that series shows up midway through the story, and a lot of cross references or cross marketing occurs.'
p1196
aS'The ending was a bit of a let down, following the familiar path of setting up a final confrontation between the monster and the heroes.'
p1197
aS'This time it was lacking in detail, and I am not sure the origin of the monster and motivations were as clearly defined as in It, for instance.'
p1198
aS'And it uses the exact same weapon as another recent King story to kill the monster and I found the last sixty pages to be more of a predictable letdown.'
p1199
aS'Overall not disappointed that I purchased, but will not be one I would recommend or ever read again.'
p1200
aS'I have given this book two stars, because it is well written, but the story itself was not at all gripping or scary to me.'
p1201
aS'I have to be honest, the book did not feel like it was even written by Stephen King.'
p1202
aS'It certainly had themes that King often employs, but they were not as in your face as in his other books, such as his struggle with alcoholism, which is mentioned in passing.'
p1203
aS'There is a shock value to the crimes, but that is quickly overshadowed by trying to figure out what is actually going on.'
p1204
aS'So I will say read this if you have nothing better in your read list right now, otherwise, I was very much disappointed with all the hype.'
p1205
aS'I ordered The Outsider and had hopes it would turn out to be a great read from King, but it just did not turn out that way.'
p1206
aS'It is not a bad novel, such as The Cell, but it also does not stand out like The Shinning, The Green Mile, or any of the many Stephen King greats.'
p1207
aS'It is also well written, which you kind of expect from King.'
p1208
aS'Its main downfall is it is so derivative that if he was sourcing off another author it would come close to being called plagiarism.'
p1209
aS'Elements from The Stand, The Shinning, are pretty evident and I would also include The Green Mile.'
p1210
aS'The source of evil was pretty lame when compared to previous horrors and the ending was not memorable and I was glad to see the book finished.'
p1211
aS'Maybe I am too hard on King and If this had been written by a new author I probably would have thought this might be someone to keep an eye on in the future.'
p1212
aS'But it is King, so all I can do is lament that while its better than some of his work and it is ranking is far below his best.'

aS'So, I am the real purchaser and I did not send a copy to anyone, and especially not a Lee Simpson of Wilmar.'

p1223
aS'And an arrest is made quickly, a beloved baseball coach and case closed but is it.'
p1224

p1225
aS'Is there an outsider and who is it, is this some supernatural being, something like a vampire or undead, or a really evil person, this was entertaining for sure, but I thought the book was almost one hundred pages too long.'
p1226
aS'As sort of spoiler, you never quite get what The Outsider is, for me, it was not quite vintage, page turning Stephen King.'

p1234
aS'The supernatural premise of the book also fell flat and was not at all scary and the demise of the bad guy was anticlimactic.'

p1245

p1248
aS'I hate having to write such a review about a Stephen King book, as I am a huge fan, but this book just fell very short of what I have read of his in the past.'

p1256
aS'I do get the sense that this book is the updated modern day take on the heroine, starting out as a Goddess and by choice, becoming mortal, while Odysseus is reimagined as the modern day hero, addicted to war much like the character in The Hurt Locker, and with more PTSD than he is willing to let on.'
p1257
aS'But forget about psychological interpretations, the point is that this is a damn good story, peopled with vivid and expertly reimagined mythical characters, if you remotely love mythology, you will love this book.'
p1258
aS'It is to the credit of Miller that most of the people and events in the book, including ones I would never heard of, in fact do appear in the mythology, though not necessarily all together in the same story and they were there in Wikipedia when I looked them up.'
p1259
aS'It is equally to her credit that the ones that do not appear or are only hinted at, which occur mostly near the end of her book, seem just as right and convincing as the genuine ones.'
p1260
aS'Although woven together from a few main myths and a number of bits and pieces, her version of the life of Circe hangs together wonderfully.'
p1261
aS'The writing is also gorgeous, the thinking wise, and the characters moving and I have not read anything this good in quite a while and I was pleased to see over and over that this book has been a New York Times best seller.'
p1262
aS'That means that a lot of other people have also discovered how meaningful these ancient stories can still be, when they are retold by as talented an author as Madeline Miller.'
p1263
aS'This is the best book that I have read in about fifteen years and it is creative, intellectually stimulating, well written, vivid, and engaging and I really enjoyed considering the events of the Odyssey through a female viewpoint.'
p1264
aS'Exploration of what it might have been like to live as a Greek goddess was quite intriguing and the book also explores existential themes associated with mortality, and consideration of guilt, repentance, and the effects that our choices, good and bad, have on those around us.'

p1268
aS'Circe is a very different character from Achilles but I grew fond of her and enjoyed her unique story and the references to events in the other book.'
p1269
aS'I learned a lot about the character and behavior of Gods that I did not find in her first book and while this story may be somewhat less epic, it is no less entertaining and interesting.'
p1270
aS'Circe is a different story with a different kind of pacing and the way Miller describes Achilles, it is hard not to idolize him and Patroclus was endearing and I wish Miller could find a way to resurrect him somehow though she probably should not.'
p1271
aS'It only makes sense though that the protagonist of her second novel be a very different character and my only dilemma with Miller is that though I know it takes an extraordinary amount of time, effort and work to produce books of this quality, I am really looking forward to her next books.'
p1272
aS'Miller, if you are reading this, please do not take any negative comments to heart and both of your books are perfect and please get started on the next ones, thank you.'
p1273
aS'The lush, evocative prose of Miller is on full display here, as well as her ability to invoke sympathy for her characters and many of the critical reviews have valid points, mainly that this is not The Song of Achilles and will not break your heart, however, I found the approach of Miller, slow and drawn out, soothing and a comfortable read.'
p1274
aS'The action felt somewhat muddled and the parts that should have been exciting did not have the emotional heft I was expecting and battles against Scylla and the first act of Circe of changing piggish mannered men into real pigs.'
p1275
aS'However, the characterization is spot on and the depiction of Miller of her characters, both major and minor, will sadden you several times over.'
p1276
aS'Many readers who are not satisfied with Circe seem to fall back, if it is a series and there are character or continuity issues, then this may have some validity.'
p1277
aS'Otherwise, it seems best to divorce oneself from the feeling for the previous work and judge the new work on its own merits.'
p1278

p1279
aS'Without a doubt, one of the best books I have read this year and vivid characters, deeply flawed but ultimately human, even when they are Gods, descriptions that bring the scenery to life, and well nuanced relationships make this book impossible to put down.'

p1281
aS'I had read and loved her previous book, The Song of Achilles, but Circe is a true masterpiece and Miller is more than a very gifted writer, although she certainly is that.'
p1282

p1283

p1284
aS'If you are familiar with Greek mythology, chances are high that you know who Circe is, shape shifter, seductress, powerful witch and legendary schemer, but Miller gives us a front row seat to some of the oldest tales in the Greek pantheon, with Circe being the daughter of a social climbing nymph and her father the god of the sun, Helios.'

p1287
aS'I knew the majority of the characters, but some I had not yet heard of and I felt like Circe was a familiar friend to me and I also enjoyed the large cast that surrounded Circe, particularly at the beginning of the book.'

aS'The book that drew me in in my childhood were by Burroughs, Heinlein, Asimov, Bradbury, but this one is not just imaginative as those were, the lyricism of the writing and the compelling story told were just breathtaking.'
p1299
aS'I really enjoyed this story and so many characters I have heard many times but did not know too much of their stories.'

aS'Circe is the daughter of the Titan god Helios, the god of the sun and she grew up in his golden halls but her story is not a happy one.'
p1301
aS'The author is fascinating in that as a goddess she finds comfort when she is with mortals and her encounter with Odysseus defines the many stories that have been told about Circe.'
p1302
aS'The author discovers her powers of witchcraft which angers the mighty god and Zeus leaving her banished and her family turning their backs on her, not that they expressed much love to begin with, but her banishment if far from boring and the events that unfold had me not wanting to put the book down.'
p1303

p1305

p1306
aS'There are a lot of characters at the beginning to set the stage for the story of Circe who is the daughter of Helios the sun god and Perse and who is a huge disappointment to everyone in the palace, especially her father.'
p1307
aS'The author interacted with many characters familiar from Greek mythology and some of her actions caused her banishment to an island by her father and she took a while to find herself and become a self taught witch.'
p1308

S'One of my biggest complaints is reliance of Herbert on jargon in the novel and he has got some made up word in practically every paragraph and it is often difficult to ever figure out what he is talking about from context.'
p1313
aS'Luckily, there is an extensive glossary, but it really takes you out of the novel if you find yourself flipping back and forth all the time and in the Kindle version, it is just plain annoying to go back and forth.'
p1314
aS'I really like it when authors use some local words in their works and it helps pull you into the world and authors like Tolkien and countless others have done it to great effect.'
p1315
aS'Just look at the amount of people out there who try to learn elvish, or Klingon, but Herbert seems to delight in popping these words in, with very little or no explanation as to what they mean, or why on earth you should care.'
p1316
aS'They come across as awkward and contrived, and not only do not add to the story, they completely detract from it and they do not explain anything, do not add to the cultural feeling and just get in the way.'
p1317
aS'That said, things finally picked up, in my copy, I realized it was on final page in my copy and things are moving along, a climactic battle is in the works and it happens between the chapters, but did that really happen.'
p1318
aS'That said though, it ends in such a way that does feed consumption of the next book and you want to, have to, know what happens next and it is just not that important for me and it took too long to build interest for me.'
p1319
aS'There were points where I was wondering about the world Herbert built, its possibility in terms of geography and geology and the biology of the place.'
p1320
aS'There were other points where I was analyzing the structural elements of the novel, thinking about narrative voice and scene selection.'
p1321
aS'Not that those are unimportant parts of considering a novel, but if your reader is thinking about them on the first read through, there is something missing, unfortunately, that is hard to pin down.'
p1322
aS'The frustration that I have is with the concept of prescience of Herbert and I like the overall concept that prescience does not mean that someone like Paul can or will know everything in detail, and that there are blind spots, but does prescience set the future in stone.'
p1323
aS'Herbert frequently implies that, but then pulls back, so Paul sees the coming jihad but wants to avoid it and every time he does something, his internal monologue reflects whether the jihad is still inevitable, but why is it inevitable, that has never made clear.'
p1324
aS'If the future can be changed, then why is Paul trapped, and, if seeing the future essentially locks it in place, how does Paul have the power to lock that future in place for the rest of the universe.'
p1325
aS'The Kwisatz Haderach has the ability to see into the past, present, and future, but how does he have the ability to force a single path on the rest of the universe.'
p1326
aS'This prescience problem becomes increasingly apparent in the sequels Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and I realize that these criticisms make it seem that I dislike Dune, but I do not.'
p1327
aS'I am frustrated because the universe and the story is so intriguing, with great potential, but the treatment feels superficial more often than not.'
p1328
aS'I first read all the Dune books probably in the late 1970s or early 80s, some of them twice and my recollection was that the final three of six were not very good.'
p1329
aS'I recently acquired the first three, Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and the first was excellent with five star.'
p1330
aS'The second was not quite as good, four star, and this third one has been a challenge to get through.'
p1331
aS'Much of the first half consists of esoteric philosophical conversations, but the pace has improved in the second half.'
p1332
aS'There is probably no more complex and imaginative world than that created by Frank Herbert on the desert planet Arrakis, and I strongly recommend the first two volumes for any science fiction fan.'
p1333
aS'The third one is probably worth your while if you have never read it, if only to see the direction this story goes in.'
p1334
aS'This was one of the first novels I loved when I first began reading Science Fiction, though today, I would call it Fantasy, after decades I find it less enthralling and the esoteric segues created less tension than a sense of get on with it and I imagine the fans will be calling for my blood, but themes or tropes that disappointed me now were.'

p1336
aS'Secondly, the repeated reference to his mother as old, despite the fact that when the Atriedes landed on Arrakis she was a woman in full bloom, mother of a fifteen year old.'
p1337
aS'After two to three years, she becomes old.'
p1338
aS'The author can not be more than forty and the world building is great, the Bene Gesserit interesting if implausible, but the characters at times seem more like symbols than people.'
p1339
aS'In a word, there is a reason it was not published when it was written, sometime between 1955 and 1965 and the characters are one dimensional, the unrealistic human interactions make a soap opera look like Shakespeare, and even the protagonist is unlikable.'
p1340
aS'The author never truly suffers and the things that were taken away from him were things he never wanted anyway.'
p1341
aS'By the time he decides to forego his revenge, events have moved beyond his control and the deep philosophical issues that make Herbert so interesting are completely absent in this book.'
p1342
aS'The only redeeming feature is that it is a peek before the concept of a people conditioned by a harsh environment, such as the Fremen, were read back into the story, allowing the fan of Herbert to see how the ideas of the author were shaped and this book is for hard core students of Herbert only.'
p1343
aS'While this book is a great read, I can not say the same about the kindle version and the formatting needs a revision, first off the chapters start with the first letter of the first word much larger and bold.'
p1344
aS'This is the formatting in the physical version but the letter is placed below the sentence making it look very awkward and this is not a deal breaker but the biggest fault is that the the table of contents only contains the the separate books within the novel and leaves out the chapters.'
p1345
aS'This is quite annoying when wanting to find a specific point or when you are used to looking at the bottom of your kindle to figure out how much time it will take you to finish the chapter.'
p1346
aS'I wrote this review mainly to bring light to these issues and hopefully amazon will be able to update the formatting.'
p1347
aS'I really want to say this book was great, but unfortunately I just can not bring myself to do it and it has attention to detail is beautiful and the way it composes action in battle is superb, but even with that the book is seemingly written with blinders.'
p1348
aS'It spends countless pages hyping up the child of prophecy, the one who will change the world.'
p1349
aS'Unfortunately though, when that change comes the parts where the book could have shined are no where to be found.'
p1350
aS'I mentioned earlier that the book shines in battle sequences and training and that is all we will and good, but when the time comes to really detail the mental mapping of a war or the conquest of an empire and the book skips it.'
p1351
aS'Progression has always been choppy, chapters end and new ones start weeks, sometimes months apart so it is easy to see how the details get missed, but if I could have read one thing in this book, I wish it could have been Muadib enacting his plan, rather than just setting it up briefly and then cutting to the end scene.'
p1352
aS'I give the story a lot of credit, but feel there were too many missed opportunities to give it anything more than a three star rating.'
p1353
aS'Since Dune is well known as classic science fiction, I have been meaning to read this book for a long time and I enjoyed reading the book, despite the confusing language, Herbert created a fascinating world with interesting characters.'
p1354
aS'However, the story line itself was predictable and dull, very little surprised me, except the ending, but only because I could not believe I read hundreds of pages for it to end this way.'
p1355
aS'It is not a bad book, so if you are a science fiction fanatic, this is probably worth a read just for what it represents and what it started for other writers, if you are looking for a fun and entertaining science fiction read, look elsewhere.'
p1356
aS'The book is amazing but if you are looking at this comment then you probably want to know about the build quality and design of the book.'
p1357
aS'The design is wonderful and I love the gold lettering and the back design is very eye catching and simple and whomever designed this deserves a generous pat on the back and the book binding itself feels old.'
p1358
aS'Like it has been read twenty times before which I do not really like and the covers themselves feel flimsy like cheap cardboard.'
p1359
aS'If you are buying this to put on a bookshelf like me then it is worth the money but if you are looking for a solid expensive feeling version of the book to read then you might want to look somewhere else.'

p1364
aS'The author discussed the effects of natural processes as well as unnatural processes affecting the extinction of species and how those extinctions lead to other extinctions.'
p1365
aS'Her references to previous mass extinctions were always linked to the story of our Earth and present day extinctions and the author talked about frogs, bats, auks, coral, and trees among other things.'
p1366
aS'The Sixth Extinction does not shy away from pointing out how each species is a part of an ecosystem and how all our ecosystems are both independent and interconnected.'
p1367
aS'The Sixth Extinction makes the research of extinction including its causes and effects accessible through great storytelling and relatable moments.'
p1368
aS'Probably not the main takeaway from the book Kolbert intended, but that is what I learned and in short humans are fantastic at killing things.'
p1369
aS'Sometimes intentionally as in the now numerous extinct bird and large mammal species that disappeared right after humans arrived.'
p1370

p1372

p1373
aS'Moreover, we have done so ever since our Neanderthal ancestors trod the earth, and then in the supreme bit of irony, modern humans did it to the Neanderthals.'

p1378
aS'The book of Kolbert, well researched and well written, tells us that we have already lighted the match and have started a fire in the barn that is our planet.'
p1379
aS'But that we seem to be blissfully sitting in the barn, smoking our cigarette and ignoring the larger fire that surrounds us.'

p1381
aS'The author in this book travels the world visiting various spots on the globe that are on the front line of what she calls the sixth extinction.'
p1382
aS'The result is an interesting and somewhat depressing travelogue of the state that our planet is in.'
p1383
aS'Unlike what I was expecting this is not a polemical book where the author is making a strong argument for what should be done to stop the extinction, but rather a observation of where the planet is at this point.'
p1384
aS'While the book is a little depressing and the author does state that much of what we are doing is not going to be easily reversed or even can be reversed she does spend a good part of the book talking about efforts to reverse damage done to the environment.'
p1385
aS'Overall I think that this book is worth reading for anyone who is interested in the state of the environment today and the impact that mankind has had on it.'
p1386
aS'It is no surprise this book won a Pulitzer Prize and Kolbert presents her argument in an objective way, weaving her travels to numerous sites around the world with scientific data that is presented in an approachable way.'
p1387
aS'One of the things I found most compelling are the profiles, both of animals that are extinct and at risk, as well as the scientists of the past and present dedicating themselves to our planet.'
p1388

p1673
aS'The very colorful and imaginative use of the various players points of view, although a bit confusing, made this a riveting and ultimately sad tale of the destruction of this period.'
p1674
aS'Such period is concerning the brief glimmer of democracy that was victimized by the internal greed, power lust and simple craziness of these Jamaican characters and factions, over which the presence and meddling hand of the US Government and its anti Cuban paranoia kept the entire country off balance, thereby preventing an honest election and the possibility of a democratic, cohesive and progressive society, all of plots, was well told.'
p1675
aS'Given the hype, I am fairly disappointed by this book and there are no characters, rather every voice in the book is an archetype.'
p1676
aS'You feel like you are dealing with types of people, rather than actual people, whose behaviors and attitudes are in commonly a blend of types.'
p1677
aS'The period in history and the location of the book is far better expressed by the musicians who were producing records at that time.'
p1678
aS'While this book tries to capture what must have been the vibrancy of that musical era, it again reduces things, like genres of music and national viewpoints, or a combination of the two, down to types.'

aS'The only character who appears to attempt to break through the stereotypes is Bob Marley.'
p1680

p1683
aS'There were some aspects of the story that seem to be a bit strained, and did not seem to add a whole lot to where the where then story came from and where it went.'
p1684
aS'That was particularly the case of the continually changing personas of Nina Burgess.'
p1685
aS'While she and her family did help to underscore the troubled relationship of uptown and ghetto Kingston, and presented in confused perception of the Nouveau rich black and brown upper middle class of itself, her continued presence at various points did not necessarily give more impact to the book.'
p1686
aS'It seemed almost a subplot , that while it did not really hurt, did add a lot to story which was already carrying itself.'

aS'As an average reader, this book was difficult for me to read, but after getting through the first chapter, I started to understand the style of writing.'
p1688

p1691
aS'I recommend it highly, it is written in English Patois, not Jamaican Patois, basically it means, it is written in the English words but the characters are speaking in Patois so the language, grammar, punctuation, is all gone out the door.'
p1692
aS'After all there is an entire chapter with no punctuation, no full stops, none except the end of the character.'
p1693
aS'Imagine reading a whole chapter of run on sentences and I actually had to read it two or three times to make sure I did not miss a punctuation mark, but there is not one.'
p1694
aS'Overall, get the book, book, audio book, it is a very good read.'
p1695
aS'This book is mesmerizing, using a 1976 attempted assassination of Bob Marley as a jumping off point for a deeply complex exploration of Jamaican politics and the gangs it spawned in the period of time that two political parties, one right leaning and the other left leaning, jockeyed for power using all tools, such as American CIA and the Medellin drug lords, at their disposal.'
p1696
aS'Marlon James is an incredible talent since his writing conveys Kingston, its ghettos, its police and its innocents, through writing that is comic, dark, exhausting and epic.'
p1697
aS'Sometimes he writes in almost a stream of Patois consciousness which while hard to follow immerses one in the rhythms of the life in Kingston, amazing and wonderful.'

p1699
aS'Really eye opening even for someone alive during the time in which the story is set.'

aS'Some mention having trouble understanding the island patois, but I found my brain quickly adapted and I really did not notice it after a short period of reading.'
p1701
aS'This book is unflinching in the face of some extremely violent events, and it is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart, however I found it to be a very rewarding and satisfying read.'
p1702
aS'I am not sure how accessible this book will be for someone who is not familiar with Jamaican patois or dialiect.'
p1703
aS'But for anyone who is willing to read it without trying to parse all the words into standard English, this is one of the best things I have ever read.'
p1704
aS'It sometimes helps just to read the dialogue out loud, of course, for those of Jamaican extraction, or even just familiar with the dialect, it is a piece of cake.'

p1877
aS'I know this book has generated tons of controversy, and after reading it, I feel like much of the criticism, undermining literature on India Shining, lackluster prose, rude, simplistic, undeserving of the Booker, was spurred by jealousy.'

aS'True it is not an Uber literary book, and the narration is so irreverent, the characters so plainly drawn, that I could not always connect, but I loved the subject.'
p1879
aS'The author fearlessly plows through the life of a village boy turned city entrepreneur, with nary a pitying glance.'

p1898

p1954
aS'Maybe that is the point, that the Chinese have to communicate at multiple levels to survive the scrutiny of the party.'
p1955
aS'This book is interesting in so far as it gives insight into Chinese culture and some of the more successful and not so people in modern China.'
p1956
aS'It is insightful, but rambles around from story to story and I did enjoy it, but felt disappointed by a lack of conclusion.'
p1957
aS'This book does not really solve anything and left me with little more than a few good stories and some more understanding of key people in modern culture or society of China.'
p1958
aS'I was hoping for a book that gives insight into why China is the way it is and what it may be like in five years and this book gives you some of that, but not enough in my opinion.'
p1959
aS'This book would make a good introduction for someone who does not know much about China and it is beautifully written, nuanced and focused on interesting individuals rather than attempting too many generalized judgments.'
p1960
aS'But if you do know something about China or, frankly, have read newspapers diligently over the past five years, you will not find much new here.'
p1961
aS'The main characters the author describes and has met are well known, indeed, the book is most interesting when the author describes his neighbors and other ordinary Chinese he meets.'
p1962
aS'The theme running through the book, aspiration versus authoritarianism, is well delineated but you will not find many new insights.'
p1963
aS'That is, perhaps, always the problem with any book that tries to summarize a nation in four hundred pages, for example, the Italians, the French.'
p1964
aS'If you have some rudimentary knowledge of China, I would rather suggest books by Peter Hessler or Leslie Chang or, for something more specialist, Michael Pettis on the economy, Henry Kissinger on foreign policy, and James Fallows, the China Airborne, or Paul Midler, poorly Made in China on business.'

p1967
aS'Also, because there is not a real chronological order to the book it feels more like a collection of vignettes about China from the last thirty years, some more interesting than others.'
p1968
aS'In the end this book just did not bring the level of insight or entertainment I was expecting.'
p1969
aS'So this book was pretty good, but it dragged on for way too long and it essentially was formatted in a manner that resembled a compilation of non fiction short stories that the author either uncovered from research or from interviews.'

p1971

aS'There was not a unifying plot to push the book along other than it was all about China.'
p1973

p1974
aS'I know it must be difficult to actually write a book on the whole developing country of China and have it all link up somehow, but yeah it did not keep my attention as one solid piece of work.'
p1975
aS'The stories in the book are nothing new to me as a Chinese and I found some of the stories not objective and comprehensive enough.'
p1976
aS'For example, the story about the Chinese media reporting a public rental apartment in Beijing costs unbelievable low rents.'
p1977
aS'I am a media practitioner in China and my colleagues went to investigate the case and proved the story true, but after all it is a good book for non Chinese who want to know more about the country.'
p1978
aS'I had high hopes for this book, having read and listened to Evan Osnos on China in the past and the title of the book is misleading.'
p1979
aS'This book is not stories of ordinary Chinese chasing their dreams in an age of ambition, but a Who is Who of famous Chinese dissidents, and people on the other extreme of the Chinese political spectrum.'
p1980
aS'The stories became repetitive, fast and I was bored half way through the book.'
p1981
aS'The book would have been interesting with more stories like Michael of Crazy English, and Lin Yifu, who swam across from Taiwan, but it has too much political bent for my taste.'
p1982
aS'This book gears towards mild sensationalism and tends to pander towards American notions of identity, freedom, and individualism.'
p1983
aS'Not really about the age of ambition but rather about how through certain individual high profile cases the notion of individualism should be favored over collectivism.'
p1984
aS'If taken the right way, these cases should lead the reader to question where this boundary is and I think that is what the book should have aimed to do instead.'
p1985
aS'Indeed, our eyes, ears, noses and other senses shape how and what we view, process, interpret, replay in our minds and then retell them and how we retell them depend upon how we perceive the real and imagined biases, expectations and reactions of our audiences.'

p1987
aS'In the humble opinion of this reviewer, who has been a novice student of geopolitical events since my days in college, I found this book heavily peppered very useful insights, here is one illustrative example.'
p1988
aS'While there is nothing novel in this book about China, The narratives of the author provoke reflection about which form of governance is most suitable for not only China, but also the US, nations in the Middle East, and the rest of the world.'
p1989

aS'Not enough Logan that he is off at sea and I thought some of the principal characters acted out of character a few times.'
p2058
aS'Overall, I did not think this attempt added much of value to the Veronica Mars canon and it was not bad but that is not the standard we Marshmallows are used to.'
p2059
aS'I am very disappointed in the content of this book, I opened it expecting something remotely like the first book and was utterly disappointed.'
p2060
aS'It felt less like I was reading a Veronica Mars mystery and more like I was reading a dime novel mystery that happened to have some characters from Veronica Mars.'
p2061
aS'One of the things I really liked about the TV show was its ability to have such intense themes like rape be prominent.'
p2062
aS'It was a real breakthrough in story telling and TV the relationships were so real in fact Veronica and Keith have been my favorite fictional parent and child duo for years.'
p2063
aS'But while reading this book it felt like there was a heavy reliance on violent, nauseating crime to hold interest.'
p2064
aS'The mystery was boring, I had little to no feelings for the characters involved and it was highly predictable.'
p2065
aS'There were several scenes that attempted at emotional but instead felt more awkward and hard to read.'
p2066
aS'It seems to me that there is no room for character development, all of them are already full grown adults with mature attitudes.'
p2067
aS'Overall I am uninterested in reading the next book if they make one unless they write a well thought out plot with actual character development and whatever ingredient that is usually there that makes Veronica Mars so enjoyable.'
p2068
aS'Nothing inherently wrong with this novel, it is just somewhat of a paint by numbers thriller.'
p2069
aS'It helps that the setting is familiar, but the problem is that none of fun characters are involved with the story line whatsoever that Logan is in Iraq, Keith is recovering from an injury, Duncan is nowhere to be found, Weevil is only in a chapter, Wallace is just, kind of there.'
p2070
aS'You know what I mean, actually, the stakes are artificially pumped by convenient Mexican cartel heirs being suspects in the case, but otherwise it merely is a Raymond Chandler novel without the enticing first person narration.'
p2071
aS'I am sure there was a lot of red tape on these characters and that Jennifer Graham did the best she could with them, but it dose not have the personality it should have.'
p2072
aS'I love the Veronica Mars TV series, but the book and movie felt very lacking to me and everytime a character was mentioned in the book I felt like it was only to connect the story to the TV show.'
p2073
aS'Duncan is even mentioned at one point, without any explanation of who Duncan is and it says something about the mother of Duncan.'
p2074
aS'If a non Veronica fan picked this book up, they would have no idea who Duncan was.'
p2075
aS'Another issue I had was that the great chemistry of the show was lacking that Veronica and Logan seemed to have very boring Skype conversations.'
p2076
aS'Wallace did not seem like himself, and I have a hard time picturing Mac quitting a successful job that actually paid her bills without a backup plan that made more money, also speaking of Back Up, what happened to the dog.'
p2077
aS'Read no further if you are not a fan, if you are, then you should know it started with two stars just because it was Rob Thomas and had Mac.'
p2078
aS'As stand alone book, I would not have finished this, our heroine was not herself, and neither was anyone else.'
p2079
aS'These are our characters all grown up, all grown up and Ronnie had Mac hanging at the office like it was a club house and all the excellent voice overs were missing because it was in third person.'
p2080
aS'Logan was the most adult character and I think it was because he was not really there, that being said, I did feel like I was back in Neptune, thanks for that, Rob.'
p2081
aS'I can not say that enough.'
p2082
aS'As long as they put these books out I will probably read them just to be back in the Veronica verse but I do not love them.'
p2083
aS'For reasons I can not quite articulate they do not totally work for me, maybe because the books try too hard to tie into previous events and existing characters instead of taking advantage of the freedom to expand.'
p2084
aS'Maybe the authors just can not capture the essence of Veronica or the tone of the show on the printed page.'
p2085
aS'I also just could not get invested in the plot, maybe because it was another rape plot which has been a constant theme and perhaps an overdone one by now, or maybe the plot just was not compelling if the identifying of elements were removed.'

p2116
aS'While the author tried really hard to fill you in on what you were missing, the fact that the key conflict of Thomas was tied up in something off camera was really off putting.'
p2117
aS'Liis was a little hard to warm up to because she emotionally distant, without any background trauma to suggest why that happened, so it was hard to figure out why Thomas was the one to break through her barriers and if you park those two things aside, this was a great read.'

p2151
aS'When I got back to the book, it contained unexplained reactions from characters and then just ended without letting the reader know if anything that happened really made a difference.'

p2163

p2164
aS'It did the rest of the story a disservice.'

aS'I then moved on to his now complete Codex Alera, which he basically wrote on a dare and it was as good or better, since my usual reading choices are fantasy.'
p2268
aS'So I really do recommend you give this book a try and I think you will love it.'
p2269
aS'So far, this book seems to be the one most appropriate for any age to read as well.'
p2270
aS'Where there are plenty of adult themes in Dresden and a couple of instances in Codex Alera, I did not see anything anyone would find inappropriate to read to a child of any age, so I think that while any adult will love it, you could get your kids in on this one as well.'
p2271
aS'Also, as a bonus to some, this series is pro cat, and in a very funny way.'
p2272
aS'I like steam punk but I have been having a hard time finding original plots and well drawn characters in most of the steam punk books I have read.'
p2273
aS'The author has provided both and more in this book and I love the sense of humor of this author, ability to create original characters set in a wonderful world created in the head of Butcher.'
p2274
aS'An added bonus in this books is that the women are not weak damsels in distress that need to be saved by the big strong man.'
p2275
aS'Nope, in the worlds built by Butcher, the women are just as smart, and just as tough, and just as capable of getting themselves into a big mess as the men.'
p2276
aS'This book is long but never boring and a great adventure from beginning to end and I look forward to reading and buying each and every book in this new, hopefully long, series.'

p2278
aS'This reviewer cannot add a lot to the rave reviews about the Windlass of Aeronaut and has actually completed his butcher routine, determined to purchase everything Jim Butcher writes on faith and faith alone.'
p2279
aS'The Windlass of Aeronaut is steam punk on steroids, full of remarkable good guys, villains and airships.'
p2280
aS'What is absolutely promising about the potential of this series is that although the first installment is absolutely fulfilling, so little has been revealed about these wonderful spires, the planet and the history of this imaginary world, that we can only expect the next books to explain and entertain again and again.'

p2284
aS'This book introduces a new, steam punk style setting and a big new cast of interesting characters.'
p2285
aS'As what is obviously intended to be the first book of a series, it does not any of their stories and it is not a five the way a great stand alone novel can be a five but it is very, very good.'
p2286
aS'Some of it is reminiscent of the Hornblower novels and there is some resemblance to things that Dianne Duane wrote and those are good things.'

aS'The tech did not strike me as all that compelling but there is this character named Rowl.'
p2288
aS'I was a little concerned when Jim announced he was stepping away from the urban fantasy of the Dresden Files for another detour into the realm of epic fantasy.'
p2289
aS'His Codex Alera series was good, but not epic, and I found myself a little disappointed.'
p2290
aS'Also, I am anything but a steam punk fan, and was rather gun shy about that aspect.'
p2291
aS'Needless to say, I was skeptical about how this new enterprise might go.'
p2292
aS'It went like the wind and I was sucked into the maelstrom from the moment I read the first word.'
p2293
aS'I found the cinder spires a fascinating world, with a unique culture, with a great deal of opportunity for it to become quite rich and full.'
p2294
aS'It is impossible to reveal a fully developed world creation in a single book, or it should be, anyway.'
p2295
aS'I have new hope that I will love this series with as much fervor as I feel toward the exploits of Harry Dresden and company, good job.'
p2296
aS'Although I am a fan of Dresden books and this book was hard to put down, yet I did not care for the Fury books at all, so I had no idea what to expect here.'
p2297
aS'The action is almost cover to cover, the characters are likable, including the cats, and well developed with amusing quirks and strengths, and the action was surprisingly well choreographed.'
p2298
aS'I am looking forward to the next book in the series.'
p2299
aS'It dose not have the same feel as either the Dresden or Furies books, so expect to be surprised.'
p2300
aS'He has created a very interesting world to explore, and left plenty of things to discover in future novels, though this one has good closure as far as it goes, which is pretty far to the end.'
p2301
aS'Quite an adventure, a blend of fantasy and light science fiction, with a very slight nod of the head to the steam punk genre.'
p2302
aS'Why did I wait so long to read this, this is a very different book, and a vastly different world than any of the Dresden Files.'
p2303
aS'I read a lot and I am honestly not sure I would have recognized Butcher as the writer without his name on it, despite having read all of the Dresden books.'
p2304
aS'There are a good half dozen major and minor characters introduced in rapid fire in this book and Butcher handles it all masterfully.'
p2305
aS'The characters are fun and the world is internally consistent, and it manages to be both good steam punk and good action, which is not often true.'
p2306
aS'I look forward to future books in this series as much as I do the next Dresden book.'
p2307
aS'The book was excellent, and my only, slight, complaint was that the Butcher did not spend a lot of time explaining things early on so readers were left to discover the how is and why is of a very intricate world without any real guidance.'
p2308
aS'You were told what crystals are and how they work, how the Spires were governed, that the surface was dangerous, but only as the story needed that information leaving the reader a bit under informed in the beginning, but do not worry since all becomes clear and the story never pauses in its high energy pace.'
p2309
aS'I can not wait for the next book, but only after Peace Talks please.'
p2310
aS'Like the Furies of Calderon, Butcher once again does a wonderful job of world building and creating memorable and wonderful characters.'
p2311
aS'This is a great start to the series and the world is generally steam punk but with a novel and interesting magic and technology system and terrific battles between airships that blend the best of naval encounters and those of the star ship Enterprise.'
p2312
aS'The characters are generally very plucky and the Victorian social setting allows for some gratifying humor.'
p2313
aS'Finally, for cat lovers out there, this book will be a must, if only to enjoy the company of the noble, loyal, and proud Prince Rowl, kit of Maul, a terrific and adorable feat of feline characterization.'

aS'All that said, I do not regret reading the novel, mainly because the first half is mostly good reading.'

p2504
aS'All the antics of the overbearing father, the alcoholic mother, the struggling genius kid, the long delayed romance, and the weird religious cult have only a tangential relationship to the science fiction part of the story, or sometimes none at all.'

aS'Wilson did a fine job at building the character persona, hence the two star rating, but the story was ineffective at best, totally boring at worst.'
p2515
aS'You can have the most interesting character, but if you have a sloppy story, the whole plot will fail.'
p2516
aS'Like Superman, comic fans all love him, but say you put him in May berry with Aunt Bea and Sheriff Andy, well then, it will flop as Superman has nobody to challenge him, but I give this author a grade C for effort.'
p2517
aS'This is a good, if extremely slow paced, novel and there is not much science in this science fiction book, though.'
p2518
aS'The story is about a brother, a sister and their closest friend, growing up in very unusual times.'
p2519
aS'It is interesting and told well, with good development of the main characters.'
p2520
aS'But the science fiction part is little more than background for most of the book, and then it is wrapped up quickly at the end, as if it were an afterthought.'
p2521

aS'This was a good read, however I have to admit after reading some other fantastic vampire novels on the market this reminded me of them in some way.'
p2726
aS'It is quite similar to the ever night series, however that was a five out of five in my eyes.'
p2727
aS'However I did like the friendship bond between Rose and Lissa, and the romance between Dimitri and Rose is hot, looking forward to reading the next in the series to see what happens between them too.'
p2728
aS'I did not like how it was focused on how attractive Rose is because she was a half vampire and that is how she was different from Moroi, honestly seemed shallow especially when it kept getting brought up even when Dimitri responds that he likes her because of her appearance.'
p2729
aS'The book is focused on an older crowd to read, as this book has contents like smoking, drinking and sexual references.'
p2730
aS'However, I enjoyed this book because it was focused on an older reader and felt it to be more realistic in some circumstances.'
p2731
aS'I am looking forward to reading the next in this series, and excited that there will be a movie coming out next year.'
p2732
aS'I enjoyed the beginning of this book, not knowing where it was headed.'

aS'But all too quickly, I was annoyed by all of the unnecessary swearing.'
p2734
aS'Good story line that girls escape from academy, brought back to school where they encounter weird events, okay character development that some characters are all too forgettable, and an alright ending to a series book.'
p2735
aS'I would be curious at how the next book in the series picks up and leaves the reader.'
p2736
aS'That being said, I would show caution on letting younger teenagers read this as I felt like there was just too much swearing.'
p2737
aS'I have no idea why I decided to read this series and I think I was looking for something to pass time on a bus or something but I turned out to be pleasantly surprised.'
p2738
aS'It is a vampire story and it is a teenage vampire story and those are rarely my genres of choice.'
p2739
aS'But it works, for one thing, Rose Hathaway is no Mary Sue.'
p2740
aS'Rose is impulsive, flawed and at times, not very likable.'
p2741
aS'The plot is fairly linear that the misunderstood girl, teenage angst, unattainable romance, social pressures, a token bitchy rival and of course, the big impending real world climax that makes everything else seem small and insignificant in comparison, but the plot does work.'
p2742
aS'Snappy plots and quick pacing make up for the lack of depth, at least no one gets bored.'
p2743
aS'Plus, the entire vampire social structure was interesting to explore with the Moroi dynamics.'
p2744
aS'It moves fast and delivers exactly what it promises, which is always a good thing.'
p2745
aS'Generic, but not trash, good for a quick read, I think, even if it does not really stick with you.'
p2746
aS'Overall three stars, great book, just too much drama.'
p2747
aS'This book reminded me of high school and who could start the most rumors or be the most popular.'
p2748
aS'This made the book seem boring after a while.'
p2749
aS'However, towards the end, the book got way better, two twist to it once you thought the bad guy was caught another popped up.'
p2750
aS'It all fell together and it was way better than twilight and the vampire diaries together.'
p2751
aS'These vamps did not live off animal blood or wolves, or being shiny in the sunlight and it did not have a romance in the middle which made it great just hated all the girl on girl drama.'

aS'Maddie was a wonderful heroine, oddly perfect for him, but we had an idea of her background.'
p2760
aS'Flame was an enigma, and I needed to understand this damaged, broken man.'
p2761
aS'What a story it was, not only how he became Flame, but how he and Maddie worked through their pain.'
p2762
aS'It was not easy, but their souls instinctively knew a kindred spirit and turned to each other for healing, even when they did not want to, when they did not understand it, when it was so freaking hard, and the payoff was so worth it.'
p2763
aS'These stories are layered with psychological quirks, for lack of a better word, and understanding and healing.'
p2764
aS'Yeah, there is violence, and it pains me, but kudos to the author for never walking away from that.'

p2767

p2768

p2769
aS'The author hit it out of the park with this book, and it is brutal, raw and passionate.'
p2770
aS'Flame and Maddie are so inherently broken, beaten down to tiny, minuscule pieces, yet, together they put each other back together.'
p2771

p2780
aS'Flame is one that does not like to be touched or to touch others.'
p2781
aS'He is very solitary in his life, the tattoos, scars and the self cutting are what makes others stay at a distance, even his brothers.'
p2782
aS'That is until he meets Maddie, it is when he is with her that you are told his story and the reason for why he is the way that he is.'
p2783

p2784
aS'You are told of some of her story in the first and second books of the series, but it is this book that you are brought to understand why Maddie is one of solidarity as well.'
p2785
aS'When Flame kills the man that Maddie was serving under, she does something that no one ever thought would happen that she hugged another person, and that person was Flame.'
p2786

p2811
aS'I love how Maddie was the strong one and I usually do not like that, but with Flame it works.'

p2836
aS'This time, the story centers on Ista, who appeared in the previous installment in a more minor role as a royal widow, generally thought to be mad.'
p2837
aS'In this book, Ista comes into her own, and there is something very satisfying about having an intelligent, irreverent forty year old woman finding adventures and purpose.'
p2838
aS'I enjoyed the book considerably and perhaps the start was marginally long winded, perhaps the romance elements were marginally too perfect, but no matter.'
p2839
aS'I note that I particularly like the Bastard God.'
p2840
aS'As I particularly like the moments of wit, I look forward to the third book.'
p2841
aS'I read the first novel, The Curse of Chalion, and loved it, so I thought I would try this one and I am so glad I did.'
p2842
aS'In the first book, Cazaril was a great main character and I loved his story, however, Ista was not a strong character at all and I was concerned since this book had her as the main character that I would not like this story as much.'
p2843
aS'Well, after reading it, I found out how wrong I was, under the guidance, Ista became a fantastic main character and I loved this book just as much as the first.'
p2844
aS'In short, I very highly recommend this book to anyone who likes high fantasy and adventure.'
p2845
aS'It is going in my Best Books collection that I keep on my Kindle to reread when I can not find any new books that look interesting, try it and I bet you like it.'
p2846
aS'The world of Chalion and the Five Gods religion that the author has created in this book and the other related works is fascinating and inspiring.'
p2847
aS'The relationship with the characters is very intimate, showing their thoughts and motivations with such delicacy and skill.'
p2848
aS'The characters are beautifully portrayed and one becomes invested quite quickly in their lives.'
p2849
aS'A whole hearted recommendation to read this and all the stories set in this universe.'
p2850
aS'I loved The Curse of Chalion, more accurately, I adored the male lead Cazaril because rarely have I so wanted to hug and love and cuddle and feed soup and cookies to a character.'
p2851
aS'This book is a follow up companion, taking a side character from the first, the mother of the female lead, and shoving her unceremoniously into the spotlight.'
p2852
aS'My beloved Cazaril is mentioned only in passing, but I still really enjoyed the read.'
p2853
aS'Ista was god touched in her youth, which basically means that she went insane for an extended period of time.'
p2854
aS'Now well into middle age, her finally had her mental faculties returned to her just in time to go on a pilgrimage after her imposing mother death where she ends up dealing with invasions and her own kidnapping.'
p2855
aS'It features zombies, the comparison of penises to birds, a rather bizarre love geometric figure who have not quite decided on the exact shape yet, a meddling Bastard god, and other fun things of that like, all filtered through the lens of a pragmatic, wry forty year old woman.'
p2856
aS'I can not help but give Paladin of Souls five stars, for one thing, it is a book of this author, which means it was written by one of the modern masters of science fiction and fantasy.'
p2857
aS'For another thing, though, it is a brilliant idea, with believable characters, including the Five Gods, several of which make appearances in this book.'
p2858
aS'For a third thing, the book has a definite spin on the classic not dead concept that really grabbed me.'
p2859
aS'I would recommend this book to any fans of this author who have not yet tried her fantasies, to any lovers of richly build fantasy worlds, and to anyone who loves a good not dead tale.'
p2860
aS'This second book of the Chalion universe picks up with a nice new direction and I was happy to see a strong female character in the lead for this book.'
p2861
aS'The choice of which character from the first novel to use as the lead character was an interesting surprise.'
p2862

p2865
aS'The conflicts, both spiritual and physical, that the characters encounter are emotionally powerful.'
p2866

p2867

p2872
aS'It predates Paladin and includes another strong main character who is mentioned a little in this story.'
p2873
aS'Paladin of Souls, a story of great soul men and women who persist through a fantasy obstacles of this world, was well worth the time and money spent on it.'

aS'It was Delicious to read the story of an underestimated, presumed addle woman go on this adventure.'
p2875
aS'And spoiler win, you get even more of our favorite of the five gods, the Bastard as he guide or gropes Ista along in her journey.'

p2877
aS'Even the main boss bad guy has layers like an onion, lots of action and less court intrigue compared to book one, off to devour book three.'
p2878
aS'This is one of my favorite non Miles books by Bujold, going into it I remember being a little worried with the main character being Ista and not one of the big characters from Curse of Chalion, but I think it really had room to breathe as a story because of it.'
p2879
aS'It is the perfect way to close up several of the threads left open in Curse and I heard the Lady that the author speak a few years ago, and she suggested that the series should have five books, one for each of the gods.'
p2880
aS'This was the book of Bastard and Chalion was obviously about the Daughter, and Hallowed Hunt about the Son, so I hope that some day we do get the final two books, one for the father and the mother.'
p2881
aS'Everyone else has said everything else there is to say about the fantasy novels of this author, especially this one, so there is not much for me to add.'
p2882
aS'I will say that I have talked to one or two people who though this and Curse of Chalion started out too slowly.'
p2883
aS'I have no idea what they are talking about and the time the author takes to craft the setting, the characters, the situation, is absolutely vital to the resolution of the story.'

aS'If you read reviews on the Gospel Coalition and elsewhere they will confirm that the principles touted in this and her previous book are not Biblical.'

aS'It is like every motivational and self help speaker you ever listened to got quoted but not necessarily credited here.'
p3667
aS'And sadly, for a book published by a Christian publisher and authored by a professing believer, there is a noticeable lack of Biblical support, some profanity, and ideas that just are not compatible with the Christian walk.'

p3672

p3706

p4253
aS'I am not an ancient Greek scholar so I can not testify to the accuracy of the translation but I can tell you that, of all the three English translations that I looked at, this one came off as the most coherent which, in retrospect, is really not saying much because some of it was still pretty rough going, especially near the end of the book.'

p4258
aS'Finally I found gestalt with this penguin translation and it is light and clear while retaining a classic grammatical style that lenses the text a feeling of heft and authority.'
p4259

aS'Sometimes the fast part of your brain will offer up an erroneous suggestion that your slow brain will accept because it is lazy and the solution seems plausible.'
p4786
aS'And then there is a bunch of information on different types of biases and influences that can lead to wrong thinking.'
p4787
aS'Bottom line, often times if you go with your gut feeling without thinking through things deliberately you will be wrong or less right than you otherwise would be.'
p4788
aS'This was a fascinating look at decision making, both intuitive and thoughtful.'
p4789
aS'He explained the process by which we can make such bad decisions and human instincts can be so very off the mark.'

p4791
aS'It is a slow read because you need to absorb each chapter, but it is worth reading.'
p4792
aS'I have read excerpts of the work of this author in many other books about decision making and rationality so I was really looking forward to reading this book.'
p4793
aS'While I found much of the material interesting, I did not find the book to be an enjoyable read like I do Malcolm Gladwell, Dan Ariely or Robert Cialdini works, as a result, it took quite a while to plow through it and I enjoy this kind of stuff.'
p4794
aS'I state that up front because I think a causal reader of those books would be disappointed with Thinking, Fast and Slow.'
p4795
aS'I did find many parts interesting and they gave me pause to consider how what was shared might be impacting my thought processes.'

p4798
aS'A bit of a slog, lots of large words that feel used for the sake of using large words.'
p4799
aS'It is one thing to utilize a grasp of grammar effectively, but when I find myself asking why not use more simplistic language to get the point across it makes the information less engaging than if a simpler approach had been utilized.'
p4800
aS'The examples provided are thought provoking, but again, it is presented with what I would compare to a college professor on tenure giving the same presentation that had been given year after year than someone who wishes to engage their audience and celebrate their knowledge together.'
p4801
aS'One of the main weaknesses of the book, if not the main weakness of the book, is ironically the fact that the book does not have much of a discussion of the nexus between these behavioral biases, on the one hand, and economics, on the other.'
p4802
aS'Related to this there is little discussion, with the exception of a little in the conclusion, on the impact of the contents of the book on the prevailing macro or micro economic theories, in particular rational expectations.'
p4803
aS'In addition, and again ironically, the book has little if any discussion of possible causes of these biases.'
p4804
aS'This is despite the fact that many seem to be caused by a subconscious need to reduce effort and the expenditure of energy on the part of decision makers.'
p4805
aS'Could the root of these biases, possibly, have an evolutionary biological explanation especially in regard to helping humanity reduce its energy consumption.'

aS'The medical and social history and Henrietta story held my attention at first, and I was fascinated by the whole concept of this disadvantaged black woman raised in a very racist society providing the world with such an important and far reaching medical breakthrough, however, as the book progressed, parts of it felt rather repetitive.'
p4870
aS'Just how many times can one repeat that certain members of the Lacks family believed that John Hopkins made millions off of Henrietta cells and wanted to sue or that some family members believed that Henrietta had been cloned.'
p4871

aS'Let me start off by saying the millennium series is one of my favorite, if not favorite books series of them all, but this book specifically let me down.'

aS'I went into this book craving more Elisabeth Salander but ended up getting too much information about characters I really did not care about.'
p4874
aS'The plot was okay, not as good as the other books, but overall just too much information.'

p4882
aS'Of course, your mileage may vary depending on your interests and expectations.'

aS'I found the topic of book interesting and think it is commendable of the author to pay tribute to Henrietta Lacks and her family for what the cells have done for the advancement of cell research.'
p4884
aS'I found the book to drag though and had a tough time making it through to the end.'
p4885
aS'I also found it a bit difficult to keep track of the characters in the story.'
p4886
aS'As a historical recount of how Henrietta Lack cell came to be used in cell research, the people involved in the history of it and how Henrietta family was affected by it, the book does a good job of covering all the details.'

aS'I like the idea of this book more than I liked the book and I felt like the author did not ever get to where she was going with this, which may be the reason why it took so long for it to get finished.'
p4894
aS'It seemed that interviews were complete and it sat for ten years.'
p4895
aS'The ending was like an entry in a diary and she did not really discover who Henrietta was as a person.'
p4896
aS'At times the book focused more on the science which was definitely interesting, but I think there was too much of a mix of science, conjecture, and fiction.'
p4897
aS'There was speculation on the mistreatment of blacks by John Hopkins but no true facts to back that up.'
p4898

aS'The character Salander is a great character but the author dose not do enough with her in any of the books.'

p4903
aS'The focus is on Blomkvist, an arrogant womanizer.'
p4904
aS'I agree with one reviewer who said they thought the author was reliving his adolescent fantasies since all these women seem to fall for Blomkvist, but there dose not seem to be any real character development so it is very hard to see why he is so attractive to these women.'

p4917

p4918
aS'The second was a mess that only Michael Bay could love, an endless stream of absurd fights, cheap Dan Brown style cliffhangers and characters whose quirks became inhuman.'
p4919

p4920
aS'A healthy early chunk of the book is spent plodding recapping the second.'
p4921
aS'The meat of it plays out in the straightest and narrowest of lines, bad guys plot lazily, good guys out think them and evil is thwarted in an emotionless climax.'

aS'The author is very detailed, but sometime it was almost too much detail.'
p4937
aS'I am admittedly more interested in Holmes than architecture so that has something to do with my review.'
p4938
aS'If you are reading this because you want to hear about Holmes, you may want to read a different book, however, if you are open to learning about the World Fair, architecture, or Chicago history, this is worth the read.'

p4940
aS'The other story in the book about the serial killer was far too macabre for me, and I had to skip over most of it that was simply pure gore.'
p4941

aS'I appreciated the story, maybe because I teach United States history, but I felt this was so badly written or edited my overall reaction was to just barely tolerate the book.'
p4946
aS'To me, not at all worthy of the buzz and praise this book got, but it saved me money by convincing me not to buy any more Erik Larson titles, or other historical fiction which is pretty much a contradiction in terms for that matter.'
p4947
aS'Not a waste of time, but neither was it a good use of time.'
p4948
aS'The book is written well, very easy to read, unlike dry history books.'
p4949
aS'However, the book itself is more about the fair than Holmes.'
p4950
aS'The passages are few and far between, always jumping around and leaves readers left to wonder what happened to his wife and child.'
p4951
aS'Also, the book has pictures but very few of the fair, for a city so spectacular you would think the author would provide more context.'
p4952
aS'Additionally a simple Google search will provide you with image of the house of horrors Holmes built.'
p4953

p4954
aS'I enjoy reading novels and true accounts of murder investigations and this was not one that I enjoyed.'
p4955
aS'I think this book might be readily accepted by students and lovers of architecture, but I did not think that was the intent of this book.'
p4956
aS'The title of the book implies something sinister, which the murderer was, however, I found myself skipping over multiple pages until I got to parts that dealt with the murders which were few and far between.'
p4957
aS'This is just my humble opinion but unless architecture rings your bell do not purchase this true account if you are searching to read a good work based on an actual murder case.'

p4966
aS'It does appear to be quite well researched, but the writing is also quite bad.'
p4967
aS'This book is a chore to read, due to the poor quality of the writing, a lot of nuance is lost in the descriptions of Holmes and his psychopathy.'
p4968
aS'The same overwrought descriptions are forced upon the reader time and again with all the grace of an elephant kicking an egg.'
p4969
aS'All the topics presented are simplified due to the bad writing, and this renders the fair and the killing spree of Holmes both very boring.'

p4971

aS'As a lover of true crime I was kind of disappointed on that front as well, again big build up.'
p4974

p4975
aS'Once I started reading I kept hoping for the chapter to end and I do not feel as if the chapters on Holmes were well presented, I wanted more detail on his methods and madness but never got it.'
p4976
aS'The majority of the book and descriptions are spent on the Worlds Fair itself down almost to the smallest of details.'
p4977

p5000
aS'I enjoyed every second I spent reading this and, truthfully, it took me many seconds as I read this over the course of one year.'
p5001
aS'The author offers a reader so much by explaining how power in local governments works and how individuals can wield their influence over people and projects indefinitely.'
p5002
aS'What I appreciated most about this book are the efforts of this author in defining other power barons of the twentieth Century such as Roosevelt and Rockefeller.'
p5003
aS'Some might argue that these portions of the book could have been edited down, but their inclusion made for a richer reading experience and almost offered mini biographies of the subjects.'

p5010
aS'It is impossible for me to conceive of what the City would have been like without his influence.'
p5011
aS'Unfortunately, like most persons of great power, the author believed that his goals were sufficiently laudable to overcome his occasional deceit, strong arming, and other abuses.'
p5012
aS'Do not let the daunting length and significant detail be off putting and this book is worth the time, cost and effort.'
p5013
aS'The author has a penchant for outstanding work, as evidenced more recently in the first two volumes of the history and this is certainly the equal.'
p5014
aS'This book is a lesson in the use of power in the life and career of Robert Moses, and the consequent effects upon the people and substructure of New York City.'
p5015
aS'Moses is such a disgusting figure, such a tyrant, that I literally found myself shaking at points.'
p5016
aS'The press was in his pocket, elitist and racist, Moses painted himself as the selfless public servant.'
p5017
aS'In reality, he cast people aside by the thousands in order to increase his power and accomplish what he wants, what a vile man.'
p5018
aS'I will never look at New York City the same again and I pray that I would never treat people the way he did.'
p5019
aS'I purchased this after having read the works of this author on Lyndon Johnson.'
p5020
aS'Very much like those books, this is a study of what makes a bad person who accomplishes great things tick.'
p5021
aS'My one grip about all of the books by the author is his tendency to belabor a point, the repeat over and over the same set of facts at times.'
p5022
aS'At times I wonder if this was due to the writer having too many research cards and not being able to discard any of them when actually composing his thoughts.'
p5023
aS'Overall, this is a very thorough historical work that is definitely not dry in its narrative style and should be read by anyone interested in power and motivation.'

aS'This is how government really works.'
p5027

p5031
aS'The author goes beyond the facts, to get the essence of not only Robert Moses, but the background and motivations of those around him and what a colorful lot they were and this book is above all a good read.'

p5033

p5034
aS'The book details his life, his intellectual brilliance, and his careful crafting of his path to virtually unlimited power.'
p5035
aS'His accomplishments are legendary but less well known is how his stubborn conceitedness ruined many of the aspects of City life and destroyed any and all who opposed him.'
p5036
aS'His negative influence on the City is at least as important as his positive influence and, having lived through his major negative affect, the spreading of slums through the City, I found it harder and harder to read and never did finish the book.'
p5037
aS'The author is a fantastic biographer and this book is every bit as good as his later multiple volume biography of Lindon Johnson.'
p5038
aS'The author remade my New York State geography, my New York State political beliefs, in writing this scathing biography of Robert Moses.'
p5039
aS'I read this book fifteen years ago, and ever since then I have never seen a highway in the same way as I did before.'
p5040

p5050
aS'For me, the book lost steam about three forth of the way through when they are trying to control the outbreak in Virginia.'
p5051
aS'This should be the high point of the book, but for some reason just kind of fizzles.'
p5052
aS'Do not get me wrong, the people involved did a great job controlling the outbreak, and I thank them for their work, but the account of the operation lacks the suspense and emotion of the first parts of the book.'
p5053
aS'Perhaps it is because in the end, we know the outbreak was contained.'
p5054
aS'I would recommend buying this book, just to learn about the virus and combat the media generated fear, but I still have not finished the book despite quick progress at the beginning.'
p5055
aS'Great information, but I just lost interest, perhaps my problem more than the author.'
p5056
aS'I fear history may be repeating itself and the author gives a thorough, thought provoking description of events from an Ebola outbreak in monkeys and delves into the possibility of it becoming transmitted across species to humans by air.'
p5057
aS'In light of what is happening in Africa today, and the fact that patients are being flown into the US for treatment, it seems this is a good primer on containment and safety procedures.'

p5063
aS'This book is really impressive and catches one attention.'
p5064
aS'The second part is about an epidemics of a fourth Ebola variety which only affects monkeys but happens to appear twenty miles from Washington.'
p5065
aS'The problem is that the whole operation reported is quite technical, bureaucratic, military stuff.'
p5066
aS'Very hard to get some excitement out of it.'
p5067
aS'The third part is about the writer trying to find out Ebola himself.'
p5068
aS'Trying to look straight in the eyes of evil and this is really, really Bad.'
p5069
aS'The expedition of the writer to Kitum Cave is absolutely pathetic.'
p5070
aS'The most boring description of the empty building were the Reston episode happened is embarrassing.'
p5071
aS'Anyway, the story is good, the writing quite poor, full of cliches such as everybody has pale blue eyes and colonels who are fixing cereals for breakfast for their kids, but it is worth having a look, especially after the new and terrible Ebola surge in west Africa that we saw.'
p5072
aS'If you want to learn anything about Ebola or viruses in general I highly advise you search for another book.'
p5073
aS'Not only did this over four hundred page book have only about a total of five useful pages of information, it also is written in a very immature fashion.'
p5074
aS'This book reminded me of a high school essay in which the author ran out of info and started throwing random facts in there to fill space.'
p5075
aS'The author would describe in detail the atmosphere, in poor manner first of all, only to not have it pertain to the story at all.'
p5076
aS'The author also described all of the people and researchers in this book to look incredibly ill advised and lacking education, making this book a struggle to get through.'
p5077
aS'Not only was the book poorly written, you can clearly tell he is unsure himself with procedures of virology and immunology.'
p5078
aS'I understand the author is only a journalist, but one that does not read up on the background of the subject he is writing about first.'
p5079
aS'There were a handful of facts I found downright wrong in this book, but I will give him the credit that we had less information about Ebola and aids in 1994 than we do now.'
p5080

p5081

p5082
aS'With automation, cyborgs, robots and algorithms running our lives while we text away it lays bare an architecture that essentially spells the most amazing technological feats you can imagine, yet there is a missing element in the wonders of technology and data that are coming every month, where does humanity fit into all of this.'

p5087
aS'Maybe we deserve it, after all we pushed out the other forms of life to a lesser position and became the supremos, the Homo Sapiens.'
p5088
aS'I have to confess that I have not read the previous book of this author, so the first chapters did not look repetitive to me although they might be for someone who has read Sapiens.'
p5089
aS'If you are looking for a book that tells you how the future will look like, this is not your book.'
p5090
aS'If you are looking for a book that gives you the tools to think about how the future might look like, then you will love this book as much as I do.'
p5091
aS'The book helps you to adopt a different point of view when thinking about humankind and the power of the new ideology based on algorithms and data that has developed in the current century and leave you with a blank slate to imagine how our society will evolve or disappear.'
p5092
aS'The author explores the future of humankind, jumping off from his insights from his first book Sapiens and aligning it with current studies and trends drawn from our increasingly data centered world.'
p5093
aS'The theme of humankind evolving into either gods or mere processors for the Internet of All Things has been explored by many science fiction books, but the author enumerates the milestones and instances we may be actually heading into that eventuality.'
p5094
aS'An enjoyable read, the author keeps it light with funny analogies and anecdotes, however, it tends to get rambling in some sections, sometimes repeating points already made clear in previous chapters.'
p5095
aS'I picked up this book soon after reading the former one and I would recommend reading in that order, although it is not a prerequisite.'
p5096
aS'This book continues the discussion started in the previous book, but in contrast, it spends a lot of time hypothesizing about humanity future.'
p5097
aS'In doing so, it quite strictly refrains from passing any judgments or making any ethical, moral arguments, one of the beauties of these two books.'
p5098

p5102
aS'I must say I found some of the predictions to be dark, not hopeful.'
p5103
aS'I was happy in the end that the author reminded his readers that these are not predictions but only possibilities and the outcomes will be up to us.'
p5104
aS'Definitely one of the most important books I have ever read and it brings together so many threads and ideas, including philosophy, religions, psychology, neurology, artificial intelligence, natural sciences, to propose a very compelling narrative on how the human society and individual condition might change as technological development will continue its evolution.'
p5105

p5124

S'First the praise, this is very readable account of an almost incredible financial fraud.'
p5227
aS'The sums of money involved are mind blowing and for the principal culprit to have achieved this from a starting point of an everyday regular person is inspiring or terrifying according to your viewpoint.'
p5228
aS'Large numbers of celebrities are identified as having essentially demeaned themselves for financial reward.'
p5229
aS'This is the tabloid approach, including micro detail about what champagne they drank, where they drank it, where their jewellery came from.'
p5230
aS'Alas, though, the analysis of the financial fraud leaves vast numbers of questions unanswered, just one example that the Malaysian, as he is frequently referred to throughout the book, regularly deceived the banking community by opening accounts in the names redolent of huge and solid financial institutions.'
p5231
aS'The tabloid reader might be inclined to think What a cunning rogue but the reader seeking quality journalism wants to know how such an obvious trick managed to fool the banks.'
p5232
aS'To put this into more everyday terms, if I opened bank accounts with names redolent of Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, the bank which believed me might well expect huge cash flows to appear, but they would surely realize that this could well be the fraudulent action of a money launderer and would undertake due diligence to ascertain the veracity of the account.'
p5233
aS'Issues such as this are not pursued inside the book.'
p5234
aS'The fraud was massive in scale and the authors did a thorough job in researching, however, it was very repetitive.'
p5235
aS'The book feels like it was written against a deadline or collaboration between the two authors.'
p5236
aS'At times, the same information is repeated, nearly verbatim, in multiple paragraphs.'
p5237
aS'I found the repetition distracting, either flesh out the full story and create some cohesiveness, or edit it down to about one third of the content.'
p5238
aS'How many times can you possibly tell us that Low was known for his outrageously extravagant parties.'
p5239
aS'This book is an incredible story of a young man who was convinced in his youth that he was entitled to become a member of the world of the wealthy and share in their greed and acquisitive DNA.'
p5240
aS'The protagonist is a real and current person who lived the higher than high life built upon a house of cards.'
p5241
aS'Calling upon the greed and avarice of the Uber wealthy who feel the rules do not apply to them, the protagonist played the game well, kept his name low on the radar, and is now hiding out somewhere in China with enough wealth to live well.'
p5242
aS'Though the schemes unfold rapidly due to technology, they continue to involve the banks, investment brokerage firms, real estate and luxury auction houses.'
p5243
aS'With old story, new characters, this book is an incredible tale, however, the book is simply a chronology of events told in a simple expository manner.'
p5244
aS'Though it is non fiction, I believe it could have been told in a more interesting and clever way and it was similar to reading a series of news articles.'
p5245
aS'A deserving topic but the treatment reminded me at times of two popular daily Malaysian newspapers I read on my frequent work trips to Kuala Lumpur as this was occurring.'
p5246
aS'This book is dense in pages, names and events but a mostly unedifying jumble, tabloid and as awkwardly trendy in its syntax in persona.'
p5247
aS'The constant use of ahead of for the preposition before heightened the impression of reading a splashy newspaper column rather than a serious book.'
p5248
aS'Mostly, the book reads like a collection of somewhat disjointed articles glued together for the sake of presenting a larger narrative.'
p5249
aS'In this sense, it is successful, as all the facts, figures, and players are collected in one convenient place for your consideration.'
p5250
aS'However, this book dose not make for riveting stuff, especially when chapter after chapter the authors employ the same formulaic structure, hook, exposition, cliffhanger, but I will chuck that to personal taste.'
p5251
aS'The biggest issue I have with the story is that for all of their work exposing this scandal, the authors failed to infuse its consequences with enough gravity to have me care about it.'
p5252
aS'In The Smartest Guys In The Room, the Enron scandal, the consequences were clear that the people of California whom the company gamed to inflate its profits and the legions of employees that lost not only their jobs but their pensions and savings as well.'
p5253
aS'I know this is reality and I should be fascinated, but there are so many people and names involved that it was hard to follow what was happening and who everyone was.'
p5254
aS'It is an complex story that the author did not really make easy to follow.'
p5255
aS'With this type of subject matter it is important to have a structure that makes it easier to understand.'
p5256
aS'Skipping around locations, threads of the story, dates.'
p5257
aS'makes the story harder to follow.'
p5258
aS'Besides, none of these people were likable or relatable so the story was hard to keep going.'
p5259
aS'It is very important though and can be summarized as follows, Joh Low, a Malaysian con man, despite lack of contacts and experience, tricks the prime minister and his wife into thrusting him with a one billion USD sovereign fund from which he promptly steals a cool seven hundred million and nobody apparently cares as he burns money in the US on celebrities, lavish parties and the like.'
p5260
aS'Not content with the money, Joh Low engineers an additional heist, this time with the help of Goldman Sachs who, for a very large fee, and despite any type of convincing business plan, underwrites a two billion bond issue which the con man again steals a large part.'

aS'Lots of people wen to jail, including the prime minister, and taxpayers will foot the bill for the adventure, Joh Low still missing, though.'
p5262
aS'This book could really have been summarized in a few news articles and it has been.'
p5263
aS'The book has other fun details about Joh Low partying with Paris Hilton and Busta Rhymes, but the true details of the fraud could have been distilled to a much shorter format.'
p5264
aS'Also, despite the length of the book, I felt the role of Tim Leisner at Goldman Sachs could have been fleshed out a bit.'
p5265
aS'The details listed largely show a banker trying to win business, glad hand, and help his client, nothing new here.'
p5266
aS'The banker lied to Goldman about the extent of his relationship with Joh Low and he was kind of a grease ball on the dating scene, but I am not seeing anything criminal.'
p5267
aS'Overall this is an average book about fraud and political graft in a developing country and it is an easy read if you want a little entertainment.'
p5268
aS'If you are looking for a detailed, sensible and well written account of what has happened, so far, in the Joh Low scandal, you will not find it in this book which is a piece of highly confused writing when it comes to the technical details of that sordid affair.'
p5269
aS'That said, if you are in the mood for what can only be described as extreme kept to crazy and spendthrift porn, this is a superb specimen of that that reads like the book long tabloid that it is.'
p5270
aS'I, for one, could not put it down after the first couple of pages, which is likely not something to be proud of.'
p5271
aS'Interesting story, pertaining to current events, but once you get the story, too detailed to listen to.'
p5272
aS'The story is great, but the book meanders from first person views of the perpetrators to views of the author.'
p5273
aS'I would have preferred they spent more time on the reporting and how they discovered all of this.'
p5274
aS'There seems to be a large sense of pride in what has been reported, but not much on how they wrote it.'

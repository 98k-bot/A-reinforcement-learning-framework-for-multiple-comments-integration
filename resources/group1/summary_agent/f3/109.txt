Spin has a great idea that the Earth is wrapped in a time distortion field that makes the world beyond Earth go by faster than Earth itself. Figuring out the nature of the spin and why it happened is the crux of the book. And, it seems the idea and some plot points were well thought out. I like big ideas, but, the characters are very one dimensional and do not grow over time. The main character, who is a young boy at the beginning of the book, acts in the same way at the start as he does at the end. He does not grow or change in any way. Another main character joins a fanatical cult. Yet, we do not experience what happened to the character that would drive this outcome. There are also people who come and go for no reason other than to further a plot point. You do not feel how these other people change the main characters at all. Towards the end, I started reading faster just because I wanted to pick up the plot points and to see why the spin happened. The fate of the characters did not interest me at all. Excellent backdrop and many great concepts as the setting for the novel. Sadly, it struck me as a brilliant short story that had been padded out to something the length of War and Peace. Nonetheless, superbly crafted writing and, if you are into Eastenders and, or psychodrama centering on the relationship between childhood friends, then you are in for a treat.

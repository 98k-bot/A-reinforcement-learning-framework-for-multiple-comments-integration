What a roller coaster ride, this book definitely lives up to its name and I do not know of any other author who can blend romance, humor, action, and devastation into one book and it come out this perfectly. Jamie has a unique creative talent that does exactly that, if you had any doubts about Thomas from reading Beautiful Oblivion, this book will completely change your mind. Too bad there are only five Maddox brothers to go around, every girl needs a Maddox in their lives and I can not wait to read about the other brothers. This book hangover from the Maddox brothers and you actually love you to pieces. They both have private affairs to deal with or let go of, but they are also both married to their jobs. No matter what though they are matching scars and I can not wait for more from Jamie and Maddox Brothers. I have falling head over heels in love with these Maddox boys and I have hated them equally. Trav was my absolute favorite, until Thomas showed up and he is a control freak, sexy, mean and dangerous and Jamie brings you into the story, she makes you feel the raw emotions she creates. You will fall in love with the characters and find yourself with a new book boyfriend after the first chapter.

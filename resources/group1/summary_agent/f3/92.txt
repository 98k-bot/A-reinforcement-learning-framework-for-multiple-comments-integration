The book is written as if the author is trying to get it through the communist party censors and he circles around issues that might be perceived as shaming the Chinese. This book is interesting in so far as it gives insight into Chinese culture and some of the more successful and not so people in modern China. It is insightful, but rambles around from story to story and I did enjoy it, but felt disappointed by a lack of conclusion. This book does not really solve anything and left me with little more than a few good stories and some more understanding of key people in modern culture or society of China. I was hoping for a book that gives insight into why China is the way it is and what it may be like in five years and this book gives you some of that, but not enough in my opinion. That is, perhaps, always the problem with any book that tries to summarize a nation in four hundred pages, for example, the Italians, the French. This book is just too boring and fragmented to accomplish the task and I regularly finish books in a day, but I just got tired of reading this one. There was not a unifying plot to push the book along other than it was all about China. For example, the story about the Chinese media reporting a public rental apartment in Beijing costs unbelievable low rents.

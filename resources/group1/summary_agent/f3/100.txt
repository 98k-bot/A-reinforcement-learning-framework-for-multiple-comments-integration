The book itself is excellent and I cannot agree more with all the other reviewers and the only thing is that this book, or rather story, was a perfect platform to steer a bit away from typical Sanderson and explore a more Robin Hobb kind of style. He could have easily made this into a full length novel where the main character goes deeply into the psychological profile of the king she is trying to save. From there, he could have easily branched out into so many sub plots that made the king who he was. I was a big Robert Jordan fan and so naturally fell into the work of Brandon and really love it especially Elantris. In that I am disappointed as there is so much potential in Elantris and where he can take it. Of the three Sanderson books I have read, this one ranks third, Elantris second, with the Mistborn trilogy ranking a heavy first. Would still recommend it to someone looking to pass the time and but not necessarily someone looking for a moving, soul changing novel. Again, a good and short read. If you are not sure, just start it, it will not take you long to figure out if you love it it not. Shai is caught replicating the Moon scepter and she now faces a choice to be put to death for practicing illegal forging, or to forge a new soul for the Emperor. Surely changing an items history would cause other items history as well.

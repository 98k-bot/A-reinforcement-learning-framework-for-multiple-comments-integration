I have waited a long time for this book, and I was not disappointing. The story took place in a very interesting world and was unlike any other science fiction book that I have read. While I rate this five stars with no reservations, I do hope that the world is further explained in future books. I cared very much for the characters that were introduced and fleshed out, but the spire and the politics surrounding it seemed a little shallow. The few mentions of the dangerous surface were enough to peak my interest, and I found myself hoping that the Predator would be stranded there. I am very much looking forward to what is in store in book two, and will order as soon as it is available. This is another great Jim Butcher series. Like his other series, this book is well written and humorous. The characters have clearly distinct personalities and are believable. I first read butcher when I picked up the Dresden Files. I then moved on to his now complete Codex Alera, which he basically wrote on a dare and it was as good or better, since my usual reading choices are fantasy. So far, this book seems to be the one most appropriate for any age to read as well. Where there are plenty of adult themes in Dresden and a couple of instances in Codex Alera, I did not see anything anyone would find inappropriate to read to a child of any age, so I think that while any adult will love it, you could get your kids in on this one as well.

Bob Marley is to sing in a concert to foster peace in bitterly divided country. The ruling communist party, aided by Cuba, tries to hang on to power against the CIA backed right wing party. Several days before the event, there is an assassination attempt against the Singer by eight gunmen. Who ordered the attack and why, this historical novel follows the lives of the hit men, from their early days in Kingston, to the 1980 and 1990 in Miami and New York. Who cares, you may ask, in fact, it was only after it won the Booker Prize that I decided to embark on this hundreds of page journey. Thus it was with great sadness that I had to renounce my favourite reading spot, my bed. At some point, my sensibilities began to accept the strangeness of this new language and to eventually come to see the musicality of lyrical prose of Marlon James. This novel is a sensorial explosion and The visual and osmic descriptions as well as the melody of the writing made for an enthralling literary experience. I got the audio version of the book and it was fantastic and it had multiple narrators so the female person was read by a female, persons with American accents read for the American characters and the same was done for the Jamaican characters. There were a large number of balls in the air for this novel and the writer kept most of them moving smoothly for the most part but there were a few that fell. Profane language is used frequently and there is a great deal of graphic violence. The focus is on people who are poor, not short on money, but poor and trying to survive any way they can, this results in hard actions by desperate people. Each chapter of this book is a first person account and some of the chapters are quite graphic in both their language and content.

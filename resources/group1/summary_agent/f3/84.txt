Coetzee is a wonderful writer, easy to read, but original and compelling. This is a dark, depressing novel, the main character here, a professor who had an affair with a young student, is not even minimally developed. Yes, we know he is cynical and selfish and we know he is supposed to represent an old white South African. We know he wants to be Byron and we are told he loves his daughter deeply, and wishes to deeply connect with her, but I did not see it. Maybe because her main function, too, is to retain her symbolism. Her response is that no woman, absolutely positively none, would voluntarily remain there when she could leave. With that construct unbelievable, the entire novel fails as a story and becomes an allegory or parable and the characters become representatives of ideas or positions and you cannot live additional lives vicariously through them. It is also a novel that heavy shoves ideas at you and it is a novel of style, written in the style of Camus, unfortunately, that is all it is, in the style of. Camus wrote in sparse, spare language about people who were believable and had soul. This novel did have an effect upon me, it made me even more dubious about important awards and literary reviewers. I do not mind depressing books as long as they provide insight, memorable images or stunning turns of phrase. This novel provides none of these and it is an awful book perhaps only redeemed by literary group think.

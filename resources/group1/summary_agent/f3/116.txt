I read this in only a couple of sittings for a clear the shelves challenge. Downloaded this book years ago and am just getting to it now. It was a fast read, but really too young adult for me. Loads of teen angst and all the stuff that goes on in high school that I have no desire to ever experience again. I did like the heroine, strong, spunky, confident. I do have the second novel in this series waiting to be cleared off the shelves, so I will continue that far, but probably no further. The book is pretty much standard for novels, however, as characters I find Rose and Lyssa interesting. They are both confident, strong women who find strength in each other and it is that relationship that spurred me on to finish the book even as I got bored with it. The author handled it very well in the first book and I like that Dimitri made the mature decision. The world building leaves something to be desired, and while I might give the next couple of books a chance in the future, this book dragged on a little too long to jump right into the next one. So I did like the world, sorta, I just did not get into it. I do not think there was enough detail there and this book is all about Rose and her emotional connection to Lissa. Everything else is just the jello sliding through the spaces of an already full tummy. The emphasis is all about Rose and her change in the past couple of years. And I mean, All about Rose, everything else is incidental.

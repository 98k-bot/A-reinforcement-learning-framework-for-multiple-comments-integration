This book is a fast paced and hilarious novel about the expendable ensigns of a Star Trekish ship in a Star Trekish world, and their Star Trekish solution to keep their officers from getting them killed on away missions. The premise tells you all you need to know about the darkly hilarious tone of this book, and that same tone dominates what happens to the characters throughout. But this is not just some clever jokey novel, the deaths carry weight, the tension is exciting, and the impact of the events are felt in core characters of Scalzi. This is not the best written book in the known universe and, as others have stated, could use a lot more variety in the presentation of dialogue, but it is a whole lot fun, and the content more than made up for any problems I had with the writing. My sister and my nephew recommended this book to me, in fact they almost tied me to a chair so I would read it. I love to read anyway, so I thought, what the heck and what an amazing book this is, it is unlike anything I have ever read before, and possibly unlike anything that will come again. The story grabs you from the first page and you are helpless and you can not put it down until you are done.

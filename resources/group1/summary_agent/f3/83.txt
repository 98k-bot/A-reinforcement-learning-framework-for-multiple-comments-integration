No, just no, when I downloaded this series to my kindle before leaving on a long European adventure, I was reminded of the old saying that if everyone else was jumping off a bridge, would you. I like sex, and god help me, I liked Twilight, mostly I loved Wuthering Heights, the book that inspired Twilight and then, this. But, Christian Grey is too young and one dimensional to be that twisted, even to be a billionaire, it would help if she actually interviewed one. Anastasia is a simpleton, through and through and one thing the book gets right, these two really belong together. I tried to turn off my intellectual understanding and proceeded to take it at just porn level, but even the love scenes failed to titillate. I only weep for all the trees that were destroyed due to this book. The concept was interesting, about a haunted man who finds an outlet through BDSM, but the execution was poor, I found nothing compelling about the lead female. I have tried to post a scathing review of how bad this book is, three times. This book is bad and do not waste your money since it is not sexy and there is better out there. Is that okay amazon, or are you gonna reject that one too and I will not rest until I get my review up. Given what I would heard about this book I expected it to be poorly written and salacious.

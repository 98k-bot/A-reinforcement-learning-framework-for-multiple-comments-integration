The dialogue works, but there are a number of problems with the whole post series Veronica Mars and I know fans loved Veronica and Logan together, but they still fail to work. Overall, as a fan, these are okay, no more, no less. Veronica Mars just is not meant to be a book and as another reviewer mentioned, the book was written too much like a script. All I kept thinking while reading it was that there was way too much detail in describing elements not really essential to the scene. I was also disappointed that Logan only made a few brief appearances and do I intend to read the next book but only because I am hopeful Logan will be more involved. A nice addition to the Veronica Mars canon, since I am assuming we treat it as following the characters stories with input from Rob Thomas. Taking place soon after the movie, it spring break in Neptune and Veronica is hired to find two missing coeds. Veronica is still dealing with the consequences of her decision to stay in Neptune, and I think that is handled nicely and the mystery, really two, is okay. Overall, I did not think this attempt added much of value to the Veronica Mars canon and it was not bad but that is not the standard we Marshmallows are used to.

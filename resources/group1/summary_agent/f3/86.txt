According to the item description the condition of the book was a nice clean copy with no writing and it was listed as in very good condition. Well there is writing in the book and the front cover has several semi transparent milky stains on it. Also they included a bookmark which turns out to be a ripped up napkin, way to splurge on that bookmark. I kinda do not want to touch the thing and the stains are really freaking me out. The book is very worn and the edges of the book are damaged and the corners of the book are dull and folded back. Not sure how I feel about this one and it isinteresting to get the perspective of Balram, the villager turned driver turned entrepreneur and it was eye opening about the caste system they have. You are from a family that makes sweets, you could only ever be good at making sweets and this dictation is read through a persons last name. If I liked a book I read, I usually keeps them for my personal library.

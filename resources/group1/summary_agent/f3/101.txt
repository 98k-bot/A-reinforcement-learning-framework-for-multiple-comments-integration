This book was a lot better than I thought it would be. I went in with extremely low expectations, reading it only because it happened to be the book club pick in my reading group. Somehow though, it ended up being, so far anyway, one of my favorite reads of the year. Sam was an unlikable heroine at first but as we watched her relive the same day over and over, we also got to watch her grow. Her arc was honestly one of the best I have seen in a good while, transforming her from an arrogant, selfish person into someone who just wanted to love, someone hopeful yet unafraid of death. All of these characters are such real depictions of teenagers and remind me how it was to be in those shoes. Loved, loved, loved this book and I could not put it down. There are some great lessons to be learned here and also a beautifully written, captivating story line. And for reference, I am a married, thirty five year old mom of two. The finish of this story left me with a bit of whiplash at how quickly it just dropped off and was over. I was so involved in the world of Sam Kingston, so invested in her character and her personal growth and her ever changing perspective of her life and the people in it, which is the mark of a great author, if you ask me, and then it was done in an instant with no wrap up. But I do want to see Sam and all her friends and family in a more settled place. And then I would feel better about putting this book down and leaving world of Sam behind. This book took me personally a while to get into.

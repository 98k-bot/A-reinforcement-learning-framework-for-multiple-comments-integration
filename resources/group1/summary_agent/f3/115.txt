As I have said many times, I will read anything that this author writes. This book was an awesome ride into the largely uncharted New Adult Paranormal frontier, and who better to lead the charge. Evil and bloodthirsty were the subjects of this new book, and boy, were they creepy. Our two heroes, Ivy and Ren have quite a job trailing and figuring out who is the big bad behind all the ruckus in New Orleans. Not to mention Ivy and Ren have undeniable and palpable chemistry. As in any good book, there is romance a plenty, but there are also great action scenes and lots of supernatural elements, including a fun side character in the form of a tiny, sassy, winged faerie. Content wise, this is New Adult, so there is some language, some sex, and violence. All in all a very fun, fast paced, thrilling read that will please any Paranormal Romance fan. My first time reading a book and it definitely left a good first impression. First off, I love Ivy personality and she do not take any crap from any one and that itself says that Ivy has a dominate personality, which I love by the way. I love how strong hearted of a person she is because she is loyal, almost to a fault. What a yummy character, new to the area, Ren has show that he is compassionate and strong. Physically and mentally, but do not let that fool you because Ren as scars along with other characters. But is not what makes him different, I love how Ren did not go all alpha male on Ivy. He knew when to step back and let her make her own choices and that just shows how mature he is. The personality of Ivy was more of a act now think later and because of her personality and Ren showed that he trusted Ivy with her decisions.

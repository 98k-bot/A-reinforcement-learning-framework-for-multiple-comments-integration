I first fell in love with Robert Heinlein as a teenager and I thoroughly enjoyed his young adult adventures, but found this one annoying. Coming back to the author as an adult, I decided to reread the books I found difficult before. I found the vivid descriptions of a possible life on the moon fascinating and the idea of a computer come to life is not that alien to us now, this was written in the 1940, I think, but the character development was constantly interesting. Even more so were the concepts and tactics of revolution, the morality and strategy behind it, all this I missed as a youngster and I now fully understand its award status. Heinlein won four Hugo Awards, at least one for this particular piece. This is not only full of action and realistic characters, it is literature in the classical sense. Who actually won the war, what kind of victory was it, what kind of loss was it, and for what end, good, or bad.

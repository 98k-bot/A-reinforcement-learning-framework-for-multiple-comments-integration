It has been so long since I have read a novel that had me laughing out loud. The complexities of time travel, the inefficiency of the bureaucracy involved, the seemingly arbitrary nature of it all, so reminiscent of our actual experiences and yet far more entertaining than a trip. The time traveling main character, exhausted by efforts to satisfy the whims of the compulsion of Lady Schrapnel to recreate a cathedral destroyed during the WWII, finds himself vacationing in Victorian England, something that the reader will find far more enjoyable than he will. I am prepared and confused and he embarks on a series of adventures with some remarkably entertaining characters. All are given some affectionate fun poking in this happy romp of a story. A special treat for Anglophiles, this is clever, light entertainment with some philosophical questions at its heart, as well. But the story get crazier, the writing is intelligent, engaging, and outright hilarious at times. The author creates oddly believable scenarios, considering the subject matter. From start to finish, I was completely immersed. The title caught my eye, as being the subtitle of classic nineteenth century novel, Three Men in a Boat. Sent this to a very dear friend and fellow admirer, anyone in that Same Boat will love it.

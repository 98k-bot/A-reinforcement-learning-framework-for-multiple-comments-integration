This is a collection of short stories and all but one of the stories are first person accounts of a soldier experience during or after deployment in Iraq. Every single story is good and every single story made me think and they are quick to read, but not easy to read. There are accounts of retrieving bodies, of devising insults to shout at insurgents in order to get them to run out into the open, of killing, of casualties, of veterans struggling with civilian life. In fiction and movies, war often has an escapist, heroic, romantic aspect. In contrast, redeployment shows war as grim rather than glorious. Both the narrators and the Iraq war are shown as flawed. Against that backdrop, there are moments when the bonds between soldiers stand out as redemptive and this is a very good book. Like another reviewer, I also did not realize this was a book of short stories at first. My son was in the army, so at times I felt like I could hear him talking about that time. The train of thought of the characters was completely realistic. I think it helped me understand him a little better by reading the experiences of the characters of others who also served.

I thoroughly enjoyed the well developed characters and plot. Lady Miranda, fighting against her engrained societal concerns and proper manners, is believable and easy to empathize with. Although readers guess the hidden truths in the plot before the charming protagonist, we are still engaged in watching her discovery process. Each of the sumptuous settings throughout the story added to the richness of the world surrounding Lady Miranda, from the rolling English countryside to the busy streets of London to the lavishly decorated country estate of the family. Looking forward to the next one in the series, if you have not found her kindle prequel to this one, you are in for a treat. I read A Lady of Esteem first to avoid spoilers found in this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Miranda was an absolutely awesome main character and Marlow was even cooler, so were all of the other side characters. Also, I am currently reading An Uncommon Courtship, the one about Trent and I really liked Trent and Griffith. There was one scene with them that I just loved and It seemed like something my brothers would do. I laughed so hard and I love the cover and It is amazing, everything about it is great. This is one of my favorite books, and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who likes an adventure and romance story. This book was unexpectedly funny and entertaining in a way that made it impossible to put it down.

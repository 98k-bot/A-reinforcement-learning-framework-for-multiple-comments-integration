This is the fourth book in a five book series and its great. Gideon and Eva are madly in love, newly married, and still getting to know one another. Gideon is a billionaire alpha male who likes control. Eva is a hard working survivor, new to New York, and maybe to swept up in Gideon. She wants equality in their marriage and communication that has been lacking up till now. You will lose the connection and emotion of the characters and the couple if you do not read the first three books before this one. I really enjoy this series its well written, has a drama filled story line, and lots of steamy scenes. It does have a lot of similarity to Fifty Shades of Grey but still worth the read and the cost, enjoy. Book four in the Crossfire series is just want I have been waiting for. This story is beautifully written and it will help readers to understand and fall in love with Gideon even more. I love getting to see him interacting with his friends because it showed that there is more to him then just his business and Eva. This chapter will melt your heart and make you cry. In this book, we learn of new threats and relationship challenges. However, there is also love, personal growth, and maturity. I am going to admit here that while I love this couple, the drama was a bit much by this point. We are on book four and the drama just keeps coming. We had some good revelations in this book and some closure to some issues, but then we have new issues popping up as well. I love this couple and I am loving this series. All these issues does show growth in their relationship and how they deal with interference so I get why the author has taken this path.

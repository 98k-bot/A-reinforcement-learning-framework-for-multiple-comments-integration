I absolutely loved the story of Flame and Maddie. The author makes sure each of her characters unique and well defined and never writes a copy and paste story. Souls Unfractured is full of touching moments that redeem the heart and twists and turns that blew me away. I highly recommend the entire series. I looked forward to this book, because I needed to know the story of Flame. Maddie was a wonderful heroine, oddly perfect for him, but we had an idea of her background. Flame was an enigma, and I needed to understand this damaged, broken man. What a story it was, not only how he became Flame, but how he and Maddie worked through their pain. These stories are layered with psychological quirks, for lack of a better word, and understanding and healing. Yeah, there is violence, and it pains me, but kudos to the author for never walking away from that. She does not pull her punches, and that gives the books a realistic tone that puts them in a class by themselves. This is the third book in this series and can not be read as a standalone, all books must be read in series order. This book contains graphic and disturbing themes, which can be triggering for some. Please read with caution since there are not enough words to adequately express my love of this book. The author hit it out of the park with this book, and it is brutal, raw and passionate. Flame and Maddie are so inherently broken, beaten down to tiny, minuscule pieces, yet, together they put each other back together. Flame is such a unique character, he is so broken yet relatable. You simply root for this character to overcome his demons.

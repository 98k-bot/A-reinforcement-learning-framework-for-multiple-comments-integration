This book is very much written in the style of a documentary having to do with the human body, here we see Jane waking up in the morning and bumbling to her bathroom to take a shower. I loved this book and was riveted by its simple yet easily emphatic writing style. It seemed like the best kind of reference book, one that you find yourself happily quoting often, super ultra thumbs up. I particularly enjoyed the customary of this author and careful craftsmanship, never over arguing a point. At times I wondered about his digressions into psychology and behavioral science, as I take it he is not an authority in either field. Nevertheless, he seems to have had good advisers, and none of it seemed to be controversial or out of place. Most of all, his moderate and even handed understanding of humanity was comforting and accessible, and perhaps closest to any truth that we can ever know. I had to buy this book for class as it was required reading, but it is not just a boring textbook or nonfiction book. The writing makes the information about society role in a person life easy to read and digestible. He includes many facts and research about how people outcomes can be determined in life and the chances of success, why some succeed and others plateau. I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in psychology and nonfiction books that are relevant to our lives. It was a good read and the book is paperback and came in time for class. If you are looking for a page turner, this book is not it.

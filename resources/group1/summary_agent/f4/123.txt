This author never disappoints, hero was a phenomenal read. It grabbed me from the first chapter and I read non stop until I finished and I did not want it to end. Caine Carraway has moved into my top ten list of sexy, alpha, hot, brooding, broken billionaires. Surprisingly, I really liked Lexi as well, I do not usually like the heroine as well as I like the hero, but Lexi held her own and was just full of smart assery which was something that Caine needed in his life and she was more than willing to provide. The secondary characters were well developed and fun to get to know. You could help but fall in love with Henry Lexington, the best friend of Caine and college buddy. Effie was the bomb and I would love to have her for my neighbor and she was such a personality. Caine needed them both in his life to keep his intensity balanced. The author definitely knows how to write characters that pull you in and make you a part of the story. This book is a roller coaster ride that you will not want to get off of. There is plenty of angst, suspense and plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat and flipping the pages, I loved it, I think you will, too. I am a big fan of On Dublin Street series of this author so I snatched up this as soon as it was released. But I am judging this book by her own work apples to apples and find it somewhat lacking but nevertheless an entertaining read. The pros is that I liked the plot and I liked the characters. The character is your typical withdrawn and cold billionaire who falls for the beautiful, yet down to earth. The character does everything she can to break past his cold exterior. The best part of the book is every once in a while the terrific writing style breaks through enough to keep you interested. The characters were two dimensional and the plot had too many melodramatic coincidences to be believable.

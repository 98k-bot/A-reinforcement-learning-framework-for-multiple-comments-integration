Lord Lavay escaped his revolution of the country that took the lives of family and friends plus their wealthy properties. He struggles financially as he lives in a rental house in England where the servants are lazy refusing to do their work. Fountain is the forth housekeeper and is given a fortnight to prove she can handle the job. It will provide food and shelter for her and her young son. Their conversations reflex this strain on their lives, but soon their banter adds a humorous aspect to the story, both are likable characters. She is intelligent, hard working, caring. He seems fierce but she discovers he suffers from a great deal of pain. She tries to resist the passion that simmers just below the surface. The love scenes are intense and the last conversation he has with her is one of the most romantic ones I have read. This is another of lovely Pennyroyal Green series of this author and it is a good one. It could have been trite that girl of the gentry with an illegitimate child reduced to making a living for herself. She applies for the position of housekeeper to an irascible French nobleman temporarily living in Pennyroyal Green while he recovers from wounds suffered while working for the Crown. The staff is slovenly and disrespectful, even thieving. The heroine, Elise, starts to shape them up, a Herculean task, while also trying to turn the Prince Philippe up sweet. She hides her son from the prince, but everyone else adores the child, including, eventually, the prince.

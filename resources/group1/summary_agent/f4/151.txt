The press is the enemy and that claim did not originate with Donald Trump, in the modern era, it originated with Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon was right then, and Trump is right now. In this book, this author concisely and provocatively shows why that was true fifty years ago, why it is true today, and what we can do about it. I could use more words to review this book, but the author says it better. Read this book, then take action. I received this book in my mailbox a couple hours ago. I am one chapter in and this is a great source of information. The author puts all his sources in the back of the book so you can check the information yourself. I am so pleased with this purchase I had to immediately review. I will update this review after I am done reading. I would suggest getting the hard back for your collection, but also get a electronic copy as well. In the electronic version you can look up the information instantly, highlight and take notes all in one place. I read this book while nodding my head up and down so many times that my chin is sore. The premise of this book is well known to all conservatives, but it is useful for the fact that the author has compiled all this information in one concise volume.

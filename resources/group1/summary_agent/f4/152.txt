I downloaded the free edition, plus I purchased this edition, as well as the audio book edition because I lived through Watergate. I, as well as any American, well understand the potential impact of this investigation and just how many years into our future this report might define the political battleground. And, make no doubt about it, it could be the opening shots in American Second Civil War. The question before us is that will our second civil war be similar to 1860, or will it be more akin to our Cold War with the Soviet Union, that could all be an over statement. With our current President first welcoming the Mueller Report as Totally exonerating Trump, then alleging that those who aided Mueller as being Traitors, I do not believe it possible to out Trump the President. To quickly learn just why Trump has done such an about face, skip forward to the beginning. You will note just how serious the warranted charges against the President are, or could be, if the House of Representatives does proceed with impeachment. If you are interested in your country and not your political party then you need to read this report. I have had the report for one hour and I have only read one hundred pages. But already I can see that all the knowledge that I have gleamed from news media of all forms is exceedingly small and confused.

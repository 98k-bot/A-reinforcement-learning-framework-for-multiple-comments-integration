This is an easy read and it is not a book I would tell someone to read if they were going through a difficult time, necessarily. It is useful to see how she managed so many disappointments, but it did not really tell me anything I did not know or practice already. I have multiple, major health problems and I read as a source of distraction from pain. The big problem the author faces is divorce. If you face earth shattering soul and heart crushing loss or life altering tragedy this book and it is sunny Jesus focused message will seem trite. The basic message is restated repeatedly. Might be most useful to a very young woman, young Christian with little life wisdom. For an older adult, the book is too theologically shallow. I was really excited to read this book and the first half was wonderful but after about chapter six, I just felt it was heavy on being a bible lesson on what all Satans tactics were and to destroy us and light on how to get victory to overcome them. It was a struggle to get through the last few chapters. I did not feel encouraged like I had hoped I would by her process through this journey. Maybe it was because she was still in the journey and I do not know. Although this book has more scripture reference than other more recent books, it is still decidedly lacking in depth.

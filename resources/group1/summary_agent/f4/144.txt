This is the second book of this author and just like her first book it is being marketed to both a Christian and secular audience. But the contents give one cause for alarm as there are many anti biblical principles and thought processes that raise some serious red flags. Just like her first book, she is putting herself and her life above all else and presenting this as the way to live even if you are a Christian, which is secular humanism. If you read reviews on the Gospel Coalition and elsewhere they will confirm that the principles touted in this and her previous book are not Biblical. Once again, if this were being marketed to an exclusive secular audience then the views presented would be pretty typical. If you are a Christian however, you will find the contents to be contrary to the Bible. It is like every motivational and self help speaker you ever listened to got quoted but not necessarily credited here. And sadly, for a book published by a Christian publisher and authored by a professing believer, there is a noticeable lack of Biblical support, some profanity, and ideas that just are not compatible with the Christian walk. I just can not recommend this to anyone.

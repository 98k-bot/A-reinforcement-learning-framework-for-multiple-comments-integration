I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for at least fifty years. This is one of the best and the whole technology class of the crashed star ship transforms themselves into the Hindu pantheon to rule the passenger descended populace scenario is unparalleled as a concept. Then, the great characters and the intricate flashback flash forward plot fleshing out this what if scenario should satisfy the most discriminating. The author was a great writer, and this was his very best work and every seven years I read it again. To do what the author has done here with beauty, grace, and power is a masterpiece. Using science fiction to explore one most influential and dynamic parts of human history is an ambitious undertaking. Buddha and Hinduism have a relation that is depicted in this story, the reactionary nature Buddha against Hindu is realized. Using a great science fiction story to do is brilliant. In the course of doing the aspects of repression, totalitarianism, freedom are explored. I read several reviews of as one star. These people need to remember the Mario Brothers and first person shooters are not the height of cultural and the intellect standards. That fast pace and simpleton cookie cutter plots are just a way to placate the ignorant. Like he said I really never claimed to be a God nor did I deny it, no good would come from either.

This is the first novel of this author I have read and It is masterfully written. The author is brilliant across the board with delightful language, plot, characters and anything else you could want in a novel, no wonder this won the Booker Prize. This technique does just what it is supposed to do. I have a music background and one of the characters is a composer, and the author devotes a good deal of time and attention to the process of writing a major orchestral work. Very nicely done, if you have not read this, you should. As to be expected from an Ian McEwan novel this has been eloquently written. It is not commercial fiction so some may find it a little bit slow paced. Read it to the end, and you will be surprised how well the characters have been developed although the time frame is just a few weeks. The plot centres around the death of Molly, a woman with a history of many lovers, including three of whom attend her funeral. The funeral sets into motion the secret fears and jealousies of the three men and their machinations to destroy one another. There is a clever twist in the tail. Friends and former lovers are gathered together, along with her husband, to honor the dearly departed Molly Lane. The day is a chilly February, and as a couple of the former lovers commiserate about the rapid onset of the disease that killed her, we see that something else is taking place. Clive is a renowned composer, while Vernon is the editor of a newspaper that has seen better days. Julian is a politician with a secret, one which someone will use as leverage against him.

This book is excruciatingly slow and pointless. So incredibly mundane and boring, and I wonder if the author was insane. Why the acclaim, I will never know, enough about Japanese conquerors obsessed with buying American Civil War memorabilia, enough about Germans landing on the moon and Mars, and German rocket ships used as commercial airlines that take you halfway around the world in forty five minutes. These are all briefly mentioned in passing, as the focus is on the turgid descriptions of stupid people consulting. This junk may have passed for an intellectual challenge in old times, but it sucks. I put it down after page sixty and flipped around and the pages ahead contained more of the same appallingly boring content. This novel sucks and I refuse to donate this book to Goodwill, as I would not want to subject anyone else to reading this horrible crap. I threw the book in the recycling bin. The novel follows five different story lines in a sort of slice of life fashion and most of these story lines are incredibly boring. You have two men who quit their factory jobs to make homemade jewelry. A business man who is learning to grow a spine and think for himself. A woman reading a book about what if Japan and Germany lost the war. The only interesting story line where a woman reads about Japan and Germany losing the war. She reads a controversial book and sets out to meet the author. The resolution to that story is adequate.

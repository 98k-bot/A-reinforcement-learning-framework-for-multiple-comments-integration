Overall, I think that it was too long, and could have done with less protracted descriptions at times and not lost anything significant. I was disappointed that actually it was really just a love story, which I was alright with for about the first fifty five percent, but then I got to the point of finding it boringly predictable, and wished that Flossie And Reeve could just get themselves together and get on with it. Having said all that I found that I actually enjoyed reading the book, and was surprised how quickly I raced through it. Tiffany Girl is basically a long, drawn out romance novel and there is not enough in the book regarding Tiffany and the windows. I just expected more from the book, the writing is okay, a little stilted, and I felt the book was too long. It could have ended much sooner, many things could have been edited from the book. I give Tiffany Girl three out of five stars. The ending is expected, you know what is going to happen from the moment Flossie and Reeve meet. I received a complimentary copy of Tiffany Girl from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Checked this book out on CD from the library. I have read mist of Deanne Gists books and thought they were pleasant, and expected this to be so.

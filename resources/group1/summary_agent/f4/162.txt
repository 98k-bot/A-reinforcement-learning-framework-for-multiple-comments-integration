This book is a clear and well crafted guide to the ins and outs of body language. Interpreting body language accurately is a major component of Emotional Intelligence, which drives success. As the authors say, body language dose not lie, so learning to send and receive appropriate signals, including micro expressions, fleeting facial expressions, can be the key to successful dating, interviewing, networking, negotiating, and team interactions. In short, body language is an additional channel of communication that we overlook at our own peril. If you want to be sure that your overall body or being is in sync with the words coming out of your mouth, you need to read this book.

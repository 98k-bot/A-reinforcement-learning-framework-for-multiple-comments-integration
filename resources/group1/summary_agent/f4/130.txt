It is an interesting and engrossing read through and through. I am not a big Heinlein fan but everything that I have read has been at least good or better and this is no exception. Presents an interesting world and characters feel real even though there is only a handful few of them in the whole story. The conflicts are well laid out and allow one to invest in the story. Other than that I would simply recommend this if you like classic science fiction find and a good story well written. More like a comic book adapted to a novella. I was waiting for Flash Gordon or Captain Zero to appear. The story line is interesting but very predictable and I guessed the ending less than midway through the book. Unfortunately, I was spot on and all the surprises and the characters played out exactly as I thought they would. The author is a very good writer but this story can be placed in any context and aside from a background of Mars, Venus and a little space travel it had little to do with science fiction. I like the book, I did, however, I can not see how it deserved to win the Hugo Award in 1956. I have begun to read all of the nominees and winners of the Hugo and Nebula awards since their inception. It clearly was a different time and mindset. I did enjoy this book, I can not deny that. While it did not enrapt me, I was very curious to turn the page. But, when all was said and done, this book did not move me in any meaningful way, nor leave me with any new thoughts. I would not quite call the book forgettable.

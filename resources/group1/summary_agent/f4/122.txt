I did not like Liz and Ben at all and I did not like that Liz had to do all the chasing. Every moment of the book was her chasing until the very end. I could not believe that Ben had any real feeling for Liz at all. With everything that he said, not wanting a relationship, not wanting his life to change, not wanting to get married, the list goes on and on. After a while I just wanted Liz to get a clue, the guy does not want this relationship and he completely ignore her after finding out she was pregnant and talking to her about it. Then he did it again when she went on tour with them. It was not convincing at all. I Loved the other books in the series though, just not this one. I read the book of Jimmy, not a fan of him at all at first but oh man did he redeem himself In that book. But Ben, I just did not understand his story why was he so afraid of commitment. Jimmy had a reason for the way he was he was physically and mentally abused but Ben had no reason. He was so washy on Liz that I just felt bad for her every other guy in the series redeemed himself but Ben I honestly do not expect him to stick around when things get tough he kept saying sweet things but would walk away when it got too hard and I wanted to scream at him and say hello. Lizzy is going through a hard time too not just you. However I will continue to read from this author because I loved the series and Jimmy and Dave had my heart and I am excited to read more from her.

I absolutely loved this book and I posted a discussion asking what were the best apocalyptic fiction books, and this book kept on popping up as a Must Read. I will admit that I would never have chosen this book based on the premise. Abbots in a monastery are driven to preserve the past and they do not even care about what is happening in the outside world. I thought, the religion and monks, but so many people recommended it that I bought it. It turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life, it truly is a masterpiece. Now that I have, I can see why it earned classic status. A group of monks in a monastery dedicated to Leibowitz, canonization pending, about thousand years after the incineration of a nuclear war and the masses deciding to kill off the elites that they blamed for it. So, all this time later they have not even discovered electricity again but one of them stumbles upon a fallout shelter with documents related to the saint, including a schematic diagram that no one can decipher, still, a fine candidate to illustrate in gold leaf with trailing flowers. At any rate, I can see why it has been dubbed a classic. At times, this book is funny, sad, thought provoking and philosophical, definitely an imaginative and worthy read. The religiously motivated philosophy of this author is made fairly clear throughout the work, and will not be to everyone taste, but it was to mine.

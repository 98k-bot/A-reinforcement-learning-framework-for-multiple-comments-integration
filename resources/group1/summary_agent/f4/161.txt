I visited Northern Ireland as a psychologist. I had been working with families of murder victims, and had the chance to learn about the differences between street violence in America and political violence in Northern Ireland. Nothing prepared me for what I found. This book is the best book I have read about the reasons for, and impact of, political violence in Ireland. It goes deeper into the minds and lives of operatives than anything I have read and it is terribly sad, and it is chillingly detailed. This is truly one of the finest pieces of investigative reporting and narrative nonfiction I have ever read. One other thing is that, this book provides a warning for those in America who ever consider the use of paramilitary violence to achieve extreme ends. The book itself is well written and filled with interesting information. My main issues lies with the way it is marketed, or more accurately, what I perceived the book to be about. It is not a true crime book where we follow around detectives or amateur sleuths. More than anything, it is a modern history book about the troubles, their legacy, and a few key players during this time.

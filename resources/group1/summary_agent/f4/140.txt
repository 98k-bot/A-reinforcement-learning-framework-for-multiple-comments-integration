I like science fiction. In the distant past, when I was a commuter, I read hundreds of science fiction books over the years. Maybe this was one of them, so I bought it and thought I would give it a chance. After quite a while of reading this, nothing happened. Maybe something was going to happen, but I am getting older and did not have any more time to wait for it. I put it away and found another book to read. It is not long, but it feels that way. There are characters whose only purpose seems to be delivering exposition. There is heavy reliance on coincidence driving the plot. There is much telling rather than showing. There are plot lines that have nothing to do with the rest of the story. The basic philosophy that drives the main musings of the character is one that makes me impatient, namely that peace will come when we all throw away our weapons. Apart from its very debatable merits, that philosophy seems refuted by the own climax of this novel in which the future of the galaxy is literally determined by use of arms. In sum, many wonderful ideas, not so wonderful storytelling. I was buying this based on I have no idea how the rural US was all that time ago, but I can not buy persistent stupidity of this guy. For example, he subscribes to the same magazine at the same address using the same name for over one hundred years. Someone at the magazine notices and calls him.

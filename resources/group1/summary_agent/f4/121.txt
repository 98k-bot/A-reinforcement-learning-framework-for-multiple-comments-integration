This Hugo and Nebula award winning novel is the second book in the World of the Five Gods trilogy, a world that includes demons in addition to the eponymous five gods. The tale picks up a few years after the opening volume, which I loved. This time, the story centers on Ista, who appeared in the previous installment in a more minor role as a royal widow, generally thought to be mad. I enjoyed the book considerably and perhaps the start was marginally long winded, perhaps the romance elements were marginally too perfect, but no matter. I note that I particularly like the Bastard God. As I particularly like the moments of wit, I look forward to the third book. I read the first novel, The Curse of Chalion, and loved it, so I thought I would try this one and I am so glad I did. In short, I very highly recommend this book to anyone who likes high fantasy and adventure. It is going in my Best Books collection that I keep on my Kindle to reread when I can not find any new books that look interesting, try it and I bet you like it. The world of Chalion and the Five Gods religion that the author has created in this book and the other related works is fascinating and inspiring. The relationship with the characters is very intimate, showing their thoughts and motivations with such delicacy and skill. The characters are beautifully portrayed and one becomes invested quite quickly in their lives.

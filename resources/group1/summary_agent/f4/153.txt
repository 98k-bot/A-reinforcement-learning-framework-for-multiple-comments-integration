I so wanted to like this book, with glowing recommendations from friends and family and a five star review I bought this book and it was a waste of money. A train wreck of a book with horrible structure and no real solid content. It was a book of fluff and humble bragging from a privileged elite woman. While I appreciate Hollis intent to encourage women I feel she misses the mark by a mile, she gives supposedly Christian advice based on misinterpreted Bible verses and non Biblical themes. I warn that this book does not support Biblical teachings at all and even seems to provide the readers with ways to justify their sin instead of follow a Godly lifestyle. I got fished by this book, based on the reviews and description, I was expecting it to be entertaining, well written, and motivational, it was not. The examples Rachel used In the book to make her points are terrible, rambling, and often off topic. She tries to be relatable, but just comes off as very out of touch. I have tread to read it and I do not think I can finish it and I am saying this while bored and bed ridden, recovering from surgery. There is nothing new or authentic in this book. It feels phony and disingenuous and like an opportunity for the author to self congratulate herself for being fabulous. I am seriously bummed I spent my money on it.

I bought this as a gift for my sister and I flipped through it extensively when it came in. I love it so much I am going to buy two more, one for a friend and one for me. I am a very visual person and the pictures in here are awesome. I love that they are not photos, but rather hand drawn looking pictures done in a watercolor way. I love the recipes that are full page visuals. There is lots of humor throughout and make no mistake though, this is a cooking book, not a cookbook. It is teaching methods and how to techniques. There is a section in the back third of the book with recipes to apply all you have learned. I love everything about this book. I can not wait to really dive into my copy and I highly recommend it. Best text about cooking I have ever read. It is both logical and fun so the lessons will stick. I would call it perfectly balanced, like a great meal. After reading the first several pages, I went poking around, only to discover that I was invited back to the beginning. You see, the book is about the journey, not the destination. It is clever, witty, helpful, intuitive, and altogether a pleasure to read. This was an excellent, excellent book. I read it cover to cover over the course of about two weeks.

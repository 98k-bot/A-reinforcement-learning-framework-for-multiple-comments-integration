This book is great for moms who have a hard time parenting due to their introverted personality. The author gives some good tips on how to get the breaks you need when you are home all day with children. I like how she incorporates some ideas from her favorite authors like Laura Ingalls Wilder and Louisa May Alcott. Seriously, I have never read a book so quickly and she took the words, heart, realities right out of the pages of my own introverted life. As a mom to four under the age of eight, this book was water to a parched soul. Not only does Jamie do a great job at identifying how introverts function, feel, and think, she then goes on to give tips and tricks for how to deliver my best self to the life to which I have been called. I received an advance digital copy of this book that I also ordered and I loved this book. By nature, extroverts speak up more than introverts, so it is so refreshing to hear from a fellow introvert. I especially appreciated that she made a distinction between self care and self improvement. She gives practical, hands on ideas for introvert moms to apply for self care not self improvement. I loved this book and plan on making it a yearly read to remind myself that God gave my children an introverted mom on purpose. I have never felt as understood in my life as I did while reading this book. I could never thank the author enough for writing this book. I do not think I can even sum up the amazing things Jamie touches on.

I am glad I read this book when I did and I am currently twenty one years old and always felt like I was stuck. I finished this book today and I think it will benefit me for the rest of my twenties. The author brings up many important topics that I never considered, like being underemployed, how important it is to have acquaintances, and discusses the importance of planning out your life sooner rather than later. Many things about this book stand out to me and I feel like I can really relate to each client she writes about. Urban tribes, choosing a family, all of these things are so important for us twenty somethings to take into consideration. This was a really well written book and I recommend it to any millennial. I would one hundred percent recommend this to anybody in their twenties, or anybody who has kids in their twenties, or anybody who will be in the twenties one day. All of you, read this book, immediately, not to sound bossy even though I definitely am. Other crazy twenty something folks who, like me, feel a little confused by this messy, wonderful, stressful, and overwhelming thing called life. It has quickly become a favorite personal growth book for me, and I recommend it to any twenty, something or anyone who knows someone in this age group. The author understands twenty somethings like myself so thoroughly. The author reminds us that this decade is not a purgatory period before life begins. It is an opportunity to prepare for the life you desire to have as an adult.

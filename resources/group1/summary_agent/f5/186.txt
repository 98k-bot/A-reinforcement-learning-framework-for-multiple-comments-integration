This was the book of the month for our reading group and I admit, I had to push myself to keep reading this book. My takeaway is that we all make bad decisions and sometimes we get lucky and make good decisions, try to make better choices. Pay attention to what you are doing and maybe you will make better choices, or maybe not. When I finished I was impressed by all the research, but left wondering how all this research could make my life or others lives any better, was it research just for the sake of research, I do not know. This book was recommended by a colleague and the premise is sound and the foundations of what the author shares is brilliant in many ways, but it could have been much more concise and to the point. Skimmed over many pages and examples to glean information that was pertinent to my interests. Still, I recommend it for others that have an interest in the psychology of thinking. While this book is more approachable than their original research papers, it is more challenging than other books that cover the same material or that explore how the research impacted various fields. Book has very great research shared, but I lost interest when I read about the half book.

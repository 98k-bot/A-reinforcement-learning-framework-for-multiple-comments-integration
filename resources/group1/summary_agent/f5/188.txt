On the one hand, this was an important book. The medical and social history and Henrietta story held my attention at first, and I was fascinated by the whole concept of this disadvantaged black woman raised in a very racist society providing the world with such an important and far reaching medical breakthrough, however, as the book progressed, parts of it felt rather repetitive. Just how many times can one repeat that certain members of the Lacks family believed that John Hopkins made millions off of Henrietta cells and wanted to sue or that some family members believed that Henrietta had been cloned. At some point, I felt that the book was over, but I still had many pages to go, in short, I do not regret reading it. The plot was okay, not as good as the other books, but overall just too much information. I was so sad that this is the last book Steig Larsson left. The Lacks family has contributed a great deal to people worldwide and hopefully can begin to find peace. As for the book, a friend and colleague had recommended it. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on your interests and expectations. I found the topic of book interesting and think it is commendable of the author to pay tribute to Henrietta Lacks and her family for what the cells have done for the advancement of cell research. I found the book to drag though and had a tough time making it through to the end. I also found it a bit difficult to keep track of the characters in the story. It also makes you think about the ethics around people and their cells, organs and how they are used in the medical research.

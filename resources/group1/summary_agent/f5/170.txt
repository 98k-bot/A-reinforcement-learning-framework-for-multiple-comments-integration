I am on half pages and burst into tears reading about the phone call between Esther and Elizabeth. Having lived through this day in an apartment not far from the Pentagon, I am not sure why I am subjecting myself to this sad book. It is not as if I need a reminder of the constant horrors we human beings inflict on each other on a daily basis because of such superficial crap as the differences in religion, race, and the dirt we live on plus money and politics. Maybe it is to seek out the feelings I remembered after 911 unity, charity, caring, helping, before all the fear crept in. After I finish this, I may go find a deserted island to live on. This was a hard read. A really hard read if you were alive during 911. This book brings all that back even harder and it is exceptional in the way it weaves all the attacks as they happened simultaneously. At the heart of this book are the personal stories which make the moments of impact and collapse completely soul wrenching. I could only put it down because I would get too upset to keep reading. There are not enough stars in the world to give this book. It is a heavily researched account of the tragedies without any political or personal embellishment by the author. Thank you to the author for honoring the heroes and innocents from that horrific day by telling their stories. This is definitely narrative storytelling at its very best.

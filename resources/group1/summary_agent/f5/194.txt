The first half of this book is pretty interesting, gets into the origins of Ebola, several early cases and talks a lot about what it is and how it is spread, really great information. For me, the book lost steam about three forth of the way through when they are trying to control the outbreak in Virginia. This should be the high point of the book, but for some reason just kind of fizzles. Perhaps it is because in the end, we know the outbreak was contained. Great information, but I just lost interest, perhaps my problem more than the author. In light of what is happening in Africa today, and the fact that patients are being flown into the US for treatment, it seems this is a good primer on containment and safety procedures. Before long, we will all have a Tyvek suit and mask stashed in every home alongside our fire extinguishers. This book was written to be the most terrible story ever told and it was designed to generate fear. After all, we are talking about the worst disease ever reported in history, which kills ninety percent of all who are infected. This book is really impressive and catches one attention. The problem is that the whole operation reported is quite technical, bureaucratic, military stuff. Very hard to get some excitement out of it. The third part is about the writer trying to find out Ebola himself. Trying to look straight in the eyes of evil and this is really, really Bad. The expedition of the writer to Kitum Cave is absolutely pathetic.

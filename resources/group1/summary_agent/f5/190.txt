I probably should have read the description a little more closely. I thought this book would cover the World Fair and Holmes in equal amounts, but this book does not. I will admit, the author thoroughly researched both topics, but it was clear to me his focus was on the architecture of the World Fair. The author is very detailed, but sometime it was almost too much detail. I gave it two stars because of its historical significance and I love to read about history, and the story of Chicago Fair was fascinating, both as to how it evolved and how it ultimately ended up. Bottom line is that I am sorry I bought the book and cannot recommend it to anyone. To everyone who told me this is a great book, did you tell me the correct title. I really struggled to get through this. I appreciated the story, maybe because I teach United States history, but I felt this was so badly written or edited my overall reaction was to just barely tolerate the book. Not a waste of time, but neither was it a good use of time. The book is written well, very easy to read, unlike dry history books. However, the book itself is more about the fair than Holmes. The passages are few and far between, always jumping around and leaves readers left to wonder what happened to his wife and child.

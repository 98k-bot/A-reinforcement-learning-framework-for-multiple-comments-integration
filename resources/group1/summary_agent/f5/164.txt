As a cancer survivor I expected to love this book, I did not. It was beautifully written and very in depth but I just felt no emotional connection to the writer at all, and I am not sure why. Maybe it was just too technical for my uneducated brain. What I got from him and my own experience is that you should never give up, believe you will get well always. Sadly he did not get well and that is tragic, but his life was not a tragedy, it was full of hope, and while going through chemo treatments hope was everything to me. The promise was a book that looked at the meaning of life from the perspective of someone with a very unique and tragic and situation and background. Interesting and heartbreaking story, but nothing more. So many people had recommended this book to me, and I was shocked by just how self absorbed and pompous Paul came across. I found him not to be relatable, disingenuous, and arrogant. Never could quite warm up to the author. He seemed to finally feel anchored with the birth of his daughter. If I had it to do over again, I would pass on this book. Bitterness, rage, anger, these makes as human as love, hope, tender kindness, indeed they alert us that those prettier emotions are not enough in the world into which we are born, and shall die. Maybe the metaphor is our coffee, adequately bitter, even without sugar, to wake you up to life in the morning.

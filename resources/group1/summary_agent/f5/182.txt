I was a little worried about picking up this book concerned that it would be lurid and make celebrities out of the killers, but I was surprised and immediately swept away since the writing is precise, clear, and lyrical and it rings like a bell calling you back for more. The depth of analysis, the sheer amount of work that went into this is stunning and it is never lurid, never written to sell copy. The characters are richly drawn and fully realized and it is the Clutter family that I remember most now that I have shut the book. As it should be, a secondary tragedy is that we do not see more of this type of reporting. Everyone knows this book and it was the first of a genre and according to many made the author a household name but also destroyed him. The book conveys the time period to us and the character of these men and to a certain extent their victims. This book shows the essential humanity of criminals involved here. What a sad book, a fascinating read, I hated to put it down even to sleep, still, the plot went quickly. The author painted such a full picture of the two killers, one can not help but wonder if the pair would have met the same fate had people known more about mental illness in 1960. The courts really did not allow a full defense in limiting the Psychiatric expert witness answers to yes or no. It was fascinating and even more chilling to know that the content in which I was reading really arose.

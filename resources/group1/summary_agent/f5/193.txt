On the whole, as for the amount of information contained in this biography it truly does merit a high rating. The author was quite fastidious is gathering and gleaning all that is included in the work. I was somewhat inundated with all the data presented. I know to many the author will still be held in high regard, his name still appears apparently on many landmarks that he built in his long association with the city and state of New York. What I look for mainly in a biography is one that tells about the person, unbiased and factual, this is such a book. It matters little whether I do or do not hold them in high regard, and that is the way I tend to view the book, information on people or subject that influenced or made a mark on society in some way. It is a rather lengthy book but I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys biographies as it is one of the best I have read to date. The book is known as a classic with good reason. What I never realized is how different the city could have been and how one man could almost be held responsible for the pitiable plight of the city. How he destroyed neighborhoods, how billions were spent on road building which only exacerbated the traffic jams instead of on modernizing and extending mass transportation. I am surprised that episodes from this book have not been made into a movie because any one of them is fascinating enough.

First the praise, this is very readable account of an almost incredible financial fraud. The sums of money involved are mind blowing and for the principal culprit to have achieved this from a starting point of an everyday regular person is inspiring or terrifying according to your viewpoint. Large numbers of celebrities are identified as having essentially demeaned themselves for financial reward. This is the tabloid approach, including micro detail about what champagne they drank, where they drank it, where their jewellery came from. To put this into more everyday terms, if I opened bank accounts with names redolent of Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, the bank which believed me might well expect huge cash flows to appear, but they would surely realize that this could well be the fraudulent action of a money launderer and would undertake due diligence to ascertain the veracity of the account. Issues such as this are not pursued inside the book. The fraud was massive in scale and the authors did a thorough job in researching, however, it was very repetitive. The book feels like it was written against a deadline or collaboration between the two authors. At times, the same information is repeated, nearly verbatim, in multiple paragraphs. I found the repetition distracting, either flesh out the full story and create some cohesiveness, or edit it down to about one third of the content.

I found this book fascinating until I found that some pages were missing because I did not start this book immediately as I was reading God This Is Anna, also from Amazon, when I got to the missing pages I was past the thirty day return time. I will now have to go through the hassle of calling Amazon and trying to get this straightened out. I can not believe that I am the first customer to discover this problem. I bought a brand new copy and just lifted it out of the box. On the cover are five distinct fingerprints of some kind of gross goo, who knows what. I attempted to take pictures but it just looks like glare. In the best case, the staffer who packed the books had just eaten a greasy ham sandwich but failed to wash his hands. In the worst case, I hate to consider. Of course, not serious enough to return the book but, gross, I paid good money for this item. I would assume better quality control, common sense, and good decent hygiene, thanks. You get used to it after a while, and might not have any difficulty reading it at all, if you already speak like that.

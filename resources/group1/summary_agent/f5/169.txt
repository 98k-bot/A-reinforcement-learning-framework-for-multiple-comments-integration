This book is gentle and supportive, and aimed at women who are dealing with emotional blockers in intimate or sexual relationships, and at their partners. If you are confident and happy in your sexuality and looking for new ideas, or dealing with complex medical issues, then you can probably skip this book. The author encourages a kind, mindful, nonjudgmental approach to exploring sex. Her writing is repetitive, but I feel that the repetition serves a purpose, she is targeting women who feel beaten down or lost, who need to hear over and over again that they are okay, they are not broken, and they deserve to be happy and feel good. The author introduces topics that range from casually interesting, to extremely vital to the health or safety of our society, arousal non concordance. I just wish there were more advice about practical action steps to change the things we want to change, I hopefully there will be a sequel. I want to hand this book out like Gospel tracts on street corners and have you heard the good news. You are normal, also, you are probably not built like a dude, so do not be surprised that your do not function like one. Take this and read this and make your partner read it and Leave it lying around so someone can steal it and find out they are okay too.

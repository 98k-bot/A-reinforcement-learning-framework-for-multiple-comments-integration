First, do we all recognize that the author of this text, Marcus Aurelius, was a Roman Emperor. If so, why have I not been forced to read this from a young age. This is quite possibly the most insightful, existential book I have ever read. Emperor Aurelius has given us wisdom in its purest form. This should be a manual for every human life. Every sentence is mind numbingly profound. This book is so good, that I might just have the entire text tattooed on my body. Marcus Aurelius has been called Plato philosopher king, and though I disagree with this, I see the point that he ruled the Roman Empire near its greatest extent with the virtues of fundamental stoicism. He did not want or consent to Plato Republic, but he put his duties, his loved ones, and his country before his own interests. Marcus Aurelius rejected luxury and comfort and he wrote to remind himself to lead by example, that he is the master of himself, that emotions cannot puppeteer him, and that pleasures cannot warp his logic and his will to do good. Marcus Aurelius reminded himself to always be favorable to all that came by him, even those that disagreed with him and spoke ill of him, for he believed they were brought to the earth to work together. Marcus Aurelius rejected unreasonable condemnation and unhelpful criticism as well as praise and arrogant pride. Marcus Aurelius looked to correct, not condemn, the ignorant, and stand agreeable and thankful, not prideful and bashful, when corrected.

As a professional working in one to one marketing, I feel like too often we succumb to flashy junk charts or otherwise ineffective presentations of data. This book seeks to break this habit by teaching typical BI professionals about how to more effectively communicate using data. The depth at which the author discusses each of the primary topics is appropriate for the majority of applications and the visuals presented are top notch. That praise aside, if you are looking to go even deeper about individual parts and pieces of charts and tables, I will also recommend you pick up Stephen Few Show Me The Numbers, as he gives an incredibly comprehensive view on the micro level of visualization design. In my opinion though, this book covers enough ground for the majority of readers and is a great way to up your game when it comes to presenting to a variety of audiences. I am going to recommend it to my colleagues as a way to lift the quality of data visualization in my department as a whole. Grateful to come across this book for several reasons. Firstly, my path to better data visuals was to save PowerPoint decks from other internal teams who had great design and message communication, I did not understand what those good design elements were until this book came along. The author concludes each chapter with a Conclusion summary and concludes the book in the same way with a summary of the key points.

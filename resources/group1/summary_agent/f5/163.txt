I adore this author and expected her book on navigating life currents and flourishing as we age, to be my new favorite must read recommendation. My enthusiasm wilted as it dawned that the book often sounds like part of my mother generation than four years my senior who graduated from high school at the dawn of the conscious raising sixties, grew up solidly in the Therapeutic Age. Where I was expecting book relevant to every part of our nation, Women Rowing North seems to largely, not exclusively. The first pages are excellent, which is why I purchased, having read a sample on my Kindle. Then the same old generalities began re how women, in this case older women, suffer at the hands of cultural stereotypes. Although I am well past my prime, I have never felt invisible or marginalized. I get that many younger people, especially younger people in passing, may have little interest in me, but this does not offend me. The first pages were worthwhile, but I stopped reading by page thirty or so. I was looking for more than a rehash of feminist precepts, repackaged for aging Baby Boomers. This is not the trailblazing book I was hoping for. I cannot think of living, or aging, without the impact of faith, no matter where that comes from. That is not particularly evident here. I would read it all before elsewhere.

This book has content that you will not see or find anywhere else. While the topic itself is covered elsewhere in large mainstream media Outlets the truth of what is actually happening is rarely ever exposed. If there was a six star recommendation or anything higher because the truth is all that matters, he would receive it. This book is put together with so many far left leading news stories as being able to support the fact of what happened. It is possible to say well that just did not happen but it was reported by the left and when you put all of the pieces of the puzzle together it is painfully obvious to see what happened. If these people involved do not go to jail the death of our Republic has already happened. I am midway through this book, just hours after it auto downloaded onto my Kindle after my order. The book is richly footnoted, with citations you can call up as desired. Recommended for anyone curious about this book scandal and its chilling importance for the country. Fantastic Book, finally, someone putting it all together so it makes sense. Then, the set up and attempt to take down a duly elected President.

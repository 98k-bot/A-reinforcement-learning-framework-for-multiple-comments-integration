All of us face really hard times if we are alive and love lots of people. I love this book and give it as gifts when I know people are going through tough times. The author has the unique ability to write in a way that you feel like a loving friend is giving you really solid, helpful, kind advice that is accessible. The wise counsel and perspective of this author through you a life jacket when you think you are going to drown. This is a book you will be glad to have and glad to give. I have been reading and rereading this book for years and years. This is my go to book during any difficult time, and I always glean something knew regarding my current situation and the writing of this author takes away a lot of the loftiness. I love this book because you can open it to any page and start reading and you will find something you can use, love it. Thank you author and I recommend all her books. I guess this book would help to mention my reasons for seeking out this genre of information. I lost about fifteen pounds on my already one hundred and twenty pound frame, and contemplated disappearing whenever I was awake and it was a completely suck time. I find the writer somewhat hard to tune into, but her knowledge of Buddhism combined with a modern zen acceptance of our modern day struggles makes her worthwhile. I got a lot out of this book in terms of changing my perspective towards setbacks in life. I would recommend to anyone searching for a deeper understanding of their own behavior and ignore the title and cut to the content.

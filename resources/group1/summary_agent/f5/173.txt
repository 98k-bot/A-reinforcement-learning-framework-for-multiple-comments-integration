The author is the real deal, seen him preach a few times and met the man once. Nothing the author has ever said was not in the best interest of those listening. At seventy two years of age and more money than he will ever spend, why would he subject himself to persecution and ridicule. The answer is simple, the author know Jesus was truly the son of God and he knows that those who open their hearts can be changed. He follows the first and second commandments, buy the book get a blessing. I would rate this the highest of the three books by this author. It is more about the gospel and not as much for entertainment as the other books and that is exactly what I needed. I started reading and could not put it down. I watched the duck hunting videos from the crazy duck hunters from Louisiana years ago and they were the best available. Who knew there was more to them river rats than duck hunting videos. A man who speaks the truth is a rarity in this day and age. The author has fortitude and exemplifies a real man. Admits when he has made mistakes and clearly loves God, Family and the USA.

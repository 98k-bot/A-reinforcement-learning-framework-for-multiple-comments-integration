Amazing, I ordered this to go along with my Sunday evening showing. I have followed this series since the beginning and I have always been the one drooling over the delicious food I see them eating. I made Crusty White Bread and Medieval Creme Bastard from The Wall, Honeyed Chicken from The North from Dorne. The bread held its shape and was fairly easy to make. It says to knead it but if you are using a mixer, be careful not to over mix it or it will end up being dense. It was crunchy on the outside and so soft on the inside. If you hold it up, it makes the crunching sound when you push on it. The chicken was delicious. I was wary of the apple cider vinegar because it made the sauce smell quite strong but it was delicious. Do not be fooled by the vinegar smell, for dessert, creme bastard was delicious. The cream was not overly sweet and the burst of the frozen blueberries made for a happy plate from me and my guest. Lastly, the Lemon Sweet took some elbow grease from juicing. The fresh taste of this beverage is everything. I will admit, it is very sweet. If you do not care for overly sweet drinks, this might not be for you but for me, I was in heaven. This entire dinner put me in the spirit for GOT and I would recommend this book to any GOT lover, this book will not disappoint you. This gift brought tears to my guys eyes, the author a huge game of thrones fan and had every other book related to it.

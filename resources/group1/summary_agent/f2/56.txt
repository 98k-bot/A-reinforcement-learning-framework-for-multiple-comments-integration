I have not yet read the entire book, but was annoyed at the author liberal snobbery in the introduction. After bringing up some individuals he had seen wearing buttons that proclaimed Frederick Douglas was a republican, he snobbishly dismisses them as some of us scholars with, shall we say, different training and research, smiled and endured. Why did must cut on people who have arrived at a different opinion than his, as I read further, I will surely be alert for liberal bias sure to come. The real problem of this book is that it is too long and it should be only two third or half of its original page length before the footnotes. However, thereafter his career fell largely into that of an itinerant orator and a newspaper editor and his speeches and prose were his life. Fine enough, because his words were powerful and they had some impact, however, the author life narrative summarizes speech after speech after speech by Douglass over those decades. I would not like it coming from any writer, but when the writer is a Caucasian, it adds an extra layer of insult. No matter how long Blight publishes, no matter his standing in the Ivy League, he will never be fit to polish Douglass boots.

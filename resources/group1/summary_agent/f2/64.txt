As usual the book started off with a bang and sets up well and it seems to be written more in the Bill Hodges trilogy style, solving a crime and more mature heroes to reflect the age of the King. In fact a character from that series shows up midway through the story, and a lot of cross references or cross marketing occurs. The ending was a bit of a let down, following the familiar path of setting up a final confrontation between the monster and the heroes. This time it was lacking in detail, and I am not sure the origin of the monster and motivations were as clearly defined as in It, for instance. Overall not disappointed that I purchased, but will not be one I would recommend or ever read again. I have given this book two stars, because it is well written, but the story itself was not at all gripping or scary to me. I have to be honest, the book did not feel like it was even written by Stephen King. It is not a bad novel, such as The Cell, but it also does not stand out like The Shinning, The Green Mile, or any of the many Stephen King greats. It is also well written, which you kind of expect from King. Elements from The Stand, The Shinning, are pretty evident and I would also include The Green Mile. I got the book and, for some reason, it did not grab me like the other books of Stephen King. Now sometimes I have trouble getting a clean download because other people have had access to my kindles. So, I am the real purchaser and I did not send a copy to anyone, and especially not a Lee Simpson of Wilmar.

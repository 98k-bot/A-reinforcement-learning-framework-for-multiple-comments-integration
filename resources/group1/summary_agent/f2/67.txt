One of my biggest complaints is reliance of Herbert on jargon in the novel and he has got some made up word in practically every paragraph and it is often difficult to ever figure out what he is talking about from context. Just look at the amount of people out there who try to learn elvish, or Klingon, but Herbert seems to delight in popping these words in, with very little or no explanation as to what they mean, or why on earth you should care. There were points where I was wondering about the world Herbert built, its possibility in terms of geography and geology and the biology of the place. There were other points where I was analyzing the structural elements of the novel, thinking about narrative voice and scene selection. I first read all the Dune books probably in the late 1970s or early 80s, some of them twice and my recollection was that the final three of six were not very good. I recently acquired the first three, Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and the first was excellent with five star. The second was not quite as good, four star, and this third one has been a challenge to get through. Much of the first half consists of esoteric philosophical conversations, but the pace has improved in the second half. The third one is probably worth your while if you have never read it, if only to see the direction this story goes in. This was one of the first novels I loved when I first began reading Science Fiction, though today, I would call it Fantasy, after decades I find it less enthralling and the esoteric segues created less tension than a sense of get on with it and I imagine the fans will be calling for my blood, but themes or tropes that disappointed me now were.

One of the best things to come through Amazon Prime and I am so happy I downloaded this one. I started reading it this morning and despite a run for coffee and bagels, finished it this afternoon. If you like Sherlock Holmes or Michael Crichton books you will like the main character and the story, a lot of fun. One of my few complaints, if you can call it that, is that the suspense is almost too well done. It became intense enough to border on painful, especially in the latter part of the book. I really had to step back and remind myself a couple of times that these awful things were not happening to me. Also, the portrayal of most of the rural police as ignorant, brutal yahoos bordered on stereotyping. Overall, however, this was a wonderful thriller or mystery, particularly strong because of its use of science beyond the usual forensics.

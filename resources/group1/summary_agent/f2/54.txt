Do not bother with the Kindle version and specifically the one with the picture of the eggs and blood. There is a kindle version that is the correct text with the title in red banner listed for more than ten dollar, but the eggs and blood version is completely different, simplified, dumb down version of the physical book. The paperback format as pictured on the product page is what I have for my physical copy and they are vastly different. I read the kindle version while at work on my computer during slow periods and then came home and attempted to read the book version where I left off, only to find that chapters did not line up. There were entire pages of conversation missing towards the end of the book between Mustapha Mond and John, the Savage, very upsetting to learn this for the entire pages. It should not be on the same product page listed as a kindle version and this book is a completely different version. I bought the Kindle edition at cheaper price and it is not the actual, original version, the one with eggs on the cover. It is a watered down, summary of sorts of the actual book and it basically takes the original version, changes the prose and wording to make it more readable and understandable in more modern language, I suppose.

I read this book as part of a monthly reading list of my book club and I was disappointed in it, and marvel that it earned a Pulitzer Prize. This book took me back to the Vietnam era and the Boat People era, and that is a time when, in real life as well as in books there were few sympathetic characters. This book is not a life I am eager to revisit. Normally I do not down rate books, as I have no desire to hurt other authors, but since this one won a Pulitzer, there is vanishingly little chance that my review will hurt the author or the sales of this book. I want to warn readers that this is tough, gritty, disturbing and powerful but not in a good way. About half of this book is mesmerizing, both in the originality of its plot and its lyrical language. It starts somewhat slowly, but once the main character arrives in California, the story really takes off. In the end, overreaches and never quite delivers on the promise of the first half of the book, but a wonderful effort, well worth the time. The writing is lyrical with bits of wisdom scattered here and there. The horror and hubris of American involvement in Vietnam and our irresponsible evacuation are something Americans should understand, but these characters are empty and not engaging. Bon loves his family and the General likes military pomp.

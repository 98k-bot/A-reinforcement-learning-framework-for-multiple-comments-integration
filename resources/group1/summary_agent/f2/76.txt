This is clearly an excellent book and I was excited to receive it and I will replace the defective one I received. That said, this book is too heavy for the light binding the publishers have given it. Because it is loaded with illustrations on high quality paper, it is a heavy book and it needs a heavier paperback binding or hardback binding and I hope the publisher is listening. Weight and volume measurements are confusing, with a dry ingredient like flour, two cups equals twelve point five ounces, the weight. With a liquid ingredient, like cream, the half cups equals four ounces, volume, not weight. Yet the introduction says that all measurements are expressed as weight as a percentage of the flour used. I have been baking for thirty years using the method of baker weighing all ingredients using grams. I convert all of my recipes from the imperial system to metric, because metric is more precise and easier to use once the conversion is made. I really wanted to like this book, in fact, I wanted to like it so much that I ordered it. I have been baking bread for over ten years in my home kitchen and feel fairly comfortable with anything from no knead artisan bread to sandwich bread to Focaccia and naan. But, I always feel like I can learn something new and I am always excited to try a new bread recipe to see if it beats the recipes I have used for years.

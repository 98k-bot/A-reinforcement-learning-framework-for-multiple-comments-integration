Really disliked this book and the premise showed promise, but I never bought it to the beginning, where we were supposed to believe the protagonist was expected to track down girls she did not know and call their parents to report on their behavior on the train. Ella is quite possibly the most boring character I have ever read and being in her personality was like sinking to the bottom of a very deep pond. The bad guy came out of absolutely no where and was so poorly motivated to go after Luke. What a waste of time reading this mess, who on earth would do that so the rest of the book never made much sense. I read comments saying this was fast paced, I disagree and I found it slow since it jumps from one character to another but not giving away much. The minute it got interesting she simply jumps to a new character and ninety percent narration, ten percent dialogue, no individuality in her characters, every sounded the same.

I loved reading Improvement and Loved the experience of reading it, because the writing flows so smoothly that I found the actual experience of reading the book a joy. The characters are connected in surprising and unpredictable ways, woven together in stories in different countries. This book is a gem, wonderful storytelling, with much insight and also rich in heart. This is a stunning book and the author so beautifully weaves multiple characters who are connected by intricate threads. Each of the richly depicted characters is working through their own challenges and seeking their own improvement. I found myself wanting more and more of these characters and deeply invested in their outcomes. This is a fast yet luxurious read and a lovely escape into a beautifully interwoven world of stunning characters.

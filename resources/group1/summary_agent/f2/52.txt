Every now and then the Man Booker judges miss the mark and Man Booker winners share common surrealistic themes, with winners being unique and bleeding edge, something that has not been done before. Sometimes the judges choose art over literature, discounting the literary deficiencies for the artistic vision and creativity and in this case, the judges selected an art installation, literary garbage. In short, I found it impossible to actually wade through this novel beyond a third and had to give up on it. I am completely open to non traditional narratives, a big fan of Palahniuk Sedaris but I am sorry to say I can only give this one star. I should have waited for more reviews before ordering this book, a waste of money for sure. I gave it a good try but was not feeling anything at all for any of the characters and I am glad it is not just me.

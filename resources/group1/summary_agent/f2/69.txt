The narrator or author sets the bar very high, to present a story that would make a skeptic to change into a believer in God and he seems not to live up to this promise. The story is not boring by any means and in the end the reader, just like one of the characters listening to the story has to make a choice. If the writer was trying to turn us into Vegetarians, he certainly made a good start and I understand he was against brutality and created an analogy with animals representing humans and humans behaving like animals. Too bad because the search for God in all religions by the boy was beautiful and the miracle of survival was exciting. I am partial to the ending and in some ways, it seems like something I would do, however, overall the ending really upset me. The entire plot just came to life and amazed me and I had come to dreading it but after it got to that two hundred mark and I was definitely intrigued. Ultimately I believe the whole purpose of the book was to reinforce that life emanates from a supreme Creator, who decides the destinies of all life. There is no chance, no coincidence, no accidents, no happenstance and we all move through a preordained cycle from birth to death at the pleasure of the Creator.

Alex Michaelides is an author to watch and this is his first novel and it is a humdinger. It is a murder mystery, told from the point of view of a psychotherapist who switches jobs so he can try to help Alicia, the silent patient of the title. Lots of issues arise during his investigation and the psychotherapist is also dealing with a cheating wife which causes him lots of extra stress. Readers are also given a look into Alicia journal, in which we learn more about her life and background. The book is a fast read, well written, exciting, and offers a surprising ending that is clever and believable, what a wonderful story. I knew nothing else about it and that served me well as I did not know there was a big surprise twist coming.

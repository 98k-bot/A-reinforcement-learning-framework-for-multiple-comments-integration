Beautifully restrained book and if you are looking for an author who holds your hold and forcefully tugs you through every emotion, every thought, and every conclusion, this is not the book for you. But if you appreciate a stunningly subtle and yet laser precise portrayal of a man who has spent his days in the pursuit of dignity, another word for being emotionless, and who realizes too late that he gave his life to an employer who did not deserve it and withheld his love from a woman who did, then pick this book up, savor it, and be prepared to laugh, cry, and think. An engrossing first person narrative from the prototypical WWII British butler, about serving the upper class, wasted lives, lack of emotional connection, and the fine line between humanitarian ideals and being duped by an evil Nazi regime. All the more incredible due to the Japanese ethnicity of the author, despite his upbringing in England. The author was only over thirties at the time of writing this book, amazing. The author has published only six books so far, but those six books has given him a deserved Nobel prize.

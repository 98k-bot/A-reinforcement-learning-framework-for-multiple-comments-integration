I wanted to like this book, but the writing was weak and it ultimately made the novel unreadable, too many cliches to note and I gave up after reading eighty percent. The author needs to work on showing rather than telling, rather than telling us that the main character had a probationary period at a new job and then explaining that the practice is customary, he should try trusting that the reader has worked and is well acquainted with the practice. I nearly did not finish the book because I understood the twist about half way through the book, all in all, I would not recommend it. Perhaps another one of this author books will sweep me away, but this one disappointed. This one seems the most likely to be of interest and supernatural and Gothic caught my attention so I figured I would give it a go.

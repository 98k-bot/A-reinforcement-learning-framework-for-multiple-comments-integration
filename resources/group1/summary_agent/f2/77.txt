It is a beautifully written story about a set of twins, a boy and girl, living in India. There are many levels to it including the characters of their mother, aunt, grandmother and uncle with whom they live. You feel the tension as the plot builds and builds. There were times I did not want to put the book down, even though the reader is aware of an ominous ending. I have to say though, I would rather feel hopeful and feel a sense of justice at the end of a story, unfortunately it left me with feelings of despair and sadness. The specific Indian issues, the caste system, relations to the British, mainly provide the backdrop on which the fundamental human issues play out. Twins, a boy and girl, separated while children, meet again decades later in their hometown in India, both of them broken people. The key to their conditions lies in the past, the reason why they were separated. The story is approached indirectly through the perspectives of two children and the adult participants, each who has a different perspective based on caste, level of education, prejudices, economic division, and politics.

The Sixth Extinction is about an unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert grabbed my attention from the first page and Kolbert illustrates the future of extinction by illuminating the history of extinction. The author travels to myriad places on the Earth to talk to scientists and historians and I felt like she took me along on her journey to places I would never go on my own. The Sixth Extinction makes the research of extinction including its causes and effects accessible through great storytelling and relatable moments. Probably not the main takeaway from the book Kolbert intended, but that is what I learned and in short humans are fantastic at killing things. Sometimes intentionally as in the now numerous extinct bird and large mammal species that disappeared right after humans arrived. Other times because we are great at moving other species and parasites around the globe then there is us destroying habitats to use as farmland. Do not forget the big one, global warming and Kolbert takes on a well written tour of all manor of death in this tale, hopefully our grandchild will be around to forgive us. If you did not realize it before, you certainly will after reading this book, no matter what humans do, intentionally or not, we accelerate the demise of all types of species from the smallest to the largest. The examination of select species and the personal stories of people studying them makes for an interesting read.

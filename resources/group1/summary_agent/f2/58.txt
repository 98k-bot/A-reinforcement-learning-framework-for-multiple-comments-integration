I am a huge fan of James Baldwin and this is the third book that I have bought from him and this is by far one of the best books written by him. I am so happy that I chose to buy this book and I do not regret a thing. It truly is astonishing how not much has changed between the races in America since 1963 and the author is such an amazing writer and this book is extremely well written. The use of words in this book are utilized in a way that makes you feel as though you are within the story of Baldwin. Also, buy this book if you are interested in reading a quality book with quality writing. This book, The Fire Next Time, is more a brilliant, masterfully constructed Supreme Court Opinion than it is a novel. And whereas I truly loved his analysis and opinions of the Negro problem in America, I still prefer his old fashion, novels with the numerous unforgettable characters, boundary breaking story lines, and sublime and poetic writing style. As someone who grew up around the world and in the presence of a rainbow of people and cultures and then became a teacher, this book broke my heart while making it whole. The introductory letter from his uncle is proof that this beautifully gifting writing courses through the veins of the Baldwin family.

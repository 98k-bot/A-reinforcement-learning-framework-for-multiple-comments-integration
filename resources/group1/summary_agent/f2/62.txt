An excellent read, and beautifully crafted and the creepy quotient will delight lovers of the genre. The matter of fact, workaday language used to describe harrowing details only serves to ratchet up the horror. Do not read this book alone at night and some of nightmarish characters will follow you around long after you have put the book down. I do not leave many reviews, but I read a lot of books and the book is one of the most original and captivating books I have read in years. This book has bursts of vivid imagery, macabre horrors, and addicting prose. Who are the Night Police and what do they want with these people, where are they from, who do they answer to, answering, or at least expounding on the ideas surrounding the Night Police would have greatly helped, in my opinion. I cannot recommend to every reader, but I can recommend it to most. While I liked the interconnected structure, I felt that the world of the stories could have been explored more. Though the writing is captivating and there are some truly scary moments, I felt this narrative was just too scattered for me to really connect to it, which would have been fine if it were just a short story collection. But as they are meant to be linked, it left me wanting more cohesion and finality. I would definitely be interested to read more writing by this author. The author has a strong and unique voice, and I love that he decided to shine a light on Russian folklore and history in this way.

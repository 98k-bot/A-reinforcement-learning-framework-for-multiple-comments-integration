You know a book is good if it stays with you a few days after reading it. The author, without being at all obvious about it, leads us through a story that has many levels and explorations of what it means to be captive. Captive to a slave owner, captive to a concept, captive in an exhibit. It looks at what it takes to be truly free. This is my first book by this author and it will not be my last. This was an interesting and somewhat unconventional take on the effects of slavery on slave and master. George Washington Black, Wash, for short, is an unlikely world traveler, inquisitive observer of nature, and gifted artist because of his beginnings as a slave on a sugar cane plantation, however, an encounter with Titch, a fellow scientist and traveler, changes the direction of the fate of Washington. As a compelling narrative, Washington Black is the kind of novel that makes me want to go back and reread it as soon as I finished. Themes of pain and suffering, we both experience and inflict resound through the story. Often bitter and horrific, the story nonetheless is hopeful and even darkly comic at times and this is a truly unique read. Stepping into this novel is like stepping into the life of a young negro slave in old Barbados.

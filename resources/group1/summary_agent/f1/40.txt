In a world where the intellectual class nearly uniformly despises Donald Trump, the celebrated historian Victor Davis Hanson has arrived to offer a clear eyed evaluation of how Trump became president, and what that may mean for the immediate future. This is not a propaganda defense of Trump, but an analysis of his campaign and his presidency so far, viewed from a top the shifting sands of American political landscape. I doubt if this book will make Hanson popular with liberals and I am also pretty sure he left them behind already, for the same reasons that voters left them behind, all of which Hanson outlines in this book. The author gave the people what they were looking for and he told them what they wanted to hear and he put his money to where his mouth is and he spoke his way into office.

I just finished the book What the Wind Knows and I have so many thoughts and feelings going through my mind and my heart right now. This just was not reading a book and this was an impossible journey of the heart. While reading, I was in Ireland, the countryside, the people, the history. I was a front seat observer into something so tragic and beautiful and heart wrenching and I barely have words. I just an in awe of Amy Harmon, just when I think she can not bring something better than she is already written, my mind and heart are just blown away. To be honest, I tend to struggle with the concept of time travel, although an older PBS special about time has changed my opinions. I was not a fan of the first Outlander book, however, I enjoyed this book and can definitely recommend it. In my opinion, the romance was more of a Victoria Holt Gothic style. One person complained about the errors in the Yeats quotes. As I am not an expert, it has been years since my school grammar lessons and now with auto correct mishaps. I am a lot more tolerant and I enjoyed this, as about halfway through it totally grabbed me. Amy Harmon tells a story like no other author I have read.

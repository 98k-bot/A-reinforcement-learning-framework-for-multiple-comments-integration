This book is well written. It definitely grabs your attention and interest. But only one of the characters is appealing to this reader and all the others are so flawed as to be unlikable or demonic. There are several tragedies, incest, cruel distant parents, betrayal of partners and murders of two innocent children, no humor, nor sympathetic characters nor hope for any kind of reasonable future. I am sorry I was sucked in, and finished the book. This book is not fast paced nor a page turner by any stretch of the imagination. The female cop is as nuts as the family condoning incest.

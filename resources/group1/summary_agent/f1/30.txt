This is not something I would normally read, but my friend Mindy and other friends raved about it, and having dived in yesterday. Here I am coming up for air on the other end of it, amazing story, written in an interview style, about an infamous rock band in the seventy, and the craziness and drama of the drugs, and relationships. Fascinating, beautiful, sad, real, and well worth the read and I can not wait to see the mini series on Netflix. I am sure that there are a lot of people eagerly awaiting the release of her next book. Overall, I really enjoyed this novel and I found this novel to be immerse and a complete page turner. I loved the world that Taylor captured of the old music scene and I can not recommend this novel more. You know that feeling when it seems like a book was written for you and you alone and that is how I feel about Daisy Jones and The Six.

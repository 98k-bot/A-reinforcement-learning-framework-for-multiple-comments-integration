The story is dialogue driven and the dialogue is magical. I laughed out loud many times as the pages flew by. There are no issues with gratuitous violence or sexual content and just a few bombs that were totally unnecessary. In fact, they were the only expletives on one page, absurd. That issue aside, this book is worth every one of those five star and then some, Bravo, Ms Vanderah. The importance of forgiveness in life is also covered. The author ties everything up at the end very nicely and all the answers are there. An interesting mix of characters also contributed to the plot. I loved the independence of Tabby. I would like to meet her and have a conversation and I highly recommended.

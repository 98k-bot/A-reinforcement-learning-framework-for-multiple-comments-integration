An interesting first hand account of the practice of polygamy from the perspective of a first wife and member of a prominent Mormon family. Presents the realities of the practice and its impact on women, men and families. A heartbreaking yet fascinating story of an amazingly strong and brilliant women who painstakingly recorded her life before. As a man I can not completely understand exactly what all these women went through, but as a human being I can certainly understand the terrible suffering that one person can bring on another. Fanny Stenhouse is a brave, honest, courageous woman and this book is such an eye opener.

I think this book presents an important topic and is relevant in today society, however, I was not impressed with the writing style. This book is almost five hundreds pages long and about two hundred of those were filled with mundane conversations and details that added nothing to the plot. I also agree with some other reviews that there were a lot of stereotypes that made it hard to read, but as I said, the story itself is relevant and will definitely spark conversations that need to be had. This book was full of stereotypes and generalizations, but, as a high school English teacher, I totally understand why kids love this book. This book sums up the lifestyle and tribulations that many kids feel or believe to be the life they live. I like the fact that I can personally relate to some of the events that takes place in this book, so it is almost as if I have gone back into time and relived some moments. After reading this book, I cried, felt anger, sympathized, learned and laughed. For me, the way this book was written got incredibly old after a while. So much hype surrounding this book, so I expected amazing and ended up feeling.

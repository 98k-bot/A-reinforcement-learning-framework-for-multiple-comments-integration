Najah was an Iraqi soldier and Zahed was an Iranian boy soldier and their meeting on the battlefield of Iraq war changed both their lives. Years later they both are in a clinic in Vancouver, Canada and what are the odds and they start talking and finally realize when and how they first met. I hate comparing books, but Meredith book affected me just like Rebecca Skloot books and both are not extraordinary fiction books written so beautifully and thoughtfully. These are not fictionalized tales and both tell the stories in straightforward sense ways. I am glad I knew the back story before going on however as it gave me hope for the ending, overall, an unforgettable story. What makes men survive years of torture as prisoners of war, what keeps them going when life is at its darkest. What lessons can you as the reader take from their journeys, one of the best books I read in a long time.

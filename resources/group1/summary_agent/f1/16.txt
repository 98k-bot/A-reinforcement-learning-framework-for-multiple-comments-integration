The one thing I did like about this book, was that it has a strong female lead character and I did, however, find the story a bit hard to get my teeth into initially but it did pick up the pace and the story line got very interesting. Action, adventure, love found, love lost, love found, but not in the normal way or romance novels. This is one of the best books I have ever read and I have read hundreds over the years. The author has woven together a beautiful tale about various types of love. The main character granddaughter serves as the story narrator as she pieces together her dying grandmother life. As the books progresses, the reader begins to put the puzzle together, but not until the final chapter do all the pieces come together. This story will have you laughing sometimes, weeping at other points, and feeling like you see and know the main players.

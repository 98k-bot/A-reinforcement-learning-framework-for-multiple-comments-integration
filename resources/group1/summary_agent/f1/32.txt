I have been a Robin Cook fan a long time but this has got to be one of the worse books he has ever written and predictable and just a lousy story and save your money. If you are a Cook fan you should know this is just not what you would expect from this author. I have read and loved every book by this author and I found this book to be lacking the usual dynamic story line and suspense. Very disappointing with an ending about as satisfying as the trial and the premise is beyond belief. For a person as smart as the hero was, he is pictured as a paranoid individual who was by all intents and purposes to be highly skilled, organized and well adjusted in crisis situations. To be highly insecure at the same time is rather unreasonable in my mind. It ended so suddenly, I was beginning to think there would be a follow up book.

The last book of The Tree of Ages but not the characters. Evil faries, good fairies, mages and magic every thing you could imagine and more. Best of all a heroine that cares more for her friends and lost friends than she does her own life. This book kept me reading for three days most books I can leave and not pick up for days. Can hardly wait for Finnur and friends further adventures, please continue to write great stories.

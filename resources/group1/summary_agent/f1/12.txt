I was hoping that this book would be a light summer read that would allow me to travel to the streets of Italy, but instead it is a cliche love story that becomes extremely boring and predictable. The characters basic backgrounds are extremely uninteresting and unconvincing that I could not entirely believe that these people could actually have any real life problems let alone any character growth. Point of view and characters are unique and interesting, plot is riveting. Then the eye rolling starts. The daughter is kidnapped by white slavers. Romantic fantasy of a 16 year old imagination written by an adult woman. Very predictable, unimaginative, disappointing. I also agree with other reviewers that the twist involving the daughter was unnecessary with no connection to the main story.

Who keeps rating this book with four and five stars and I am generally one of the most open people to defining art but this stuff is not art. This is some of the most trite poetry I have ever read, and exemplifies zero skill of poetic craft and Hallmark cards are better poetry. It seriously worries me that this is what passes for poetry today and people eat it up and says more about the shallowness of readers than it dose about her poetic skill. I was looking for poetry by a young upcoming poet and maybe I am stuck enjoying an older generation of poets who grew up without the advent of social media and this book reads like a bunch of text messages.

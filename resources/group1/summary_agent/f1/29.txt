A haunting book about a young woman serving life in prison and how she got there, writing and dialogue spot on. It says a lot about our society and the people who have the deck stacked against them from birth. My only complaint was the way it ended and there needed to be more, maybe a sequel. This is a dark book without much joy to be found, but it is real, the writing is excellent and it grabs you until the end. I was looking for some good books for my holiday vacation and purchased The Mars Room based on glowing recommendations from the Today Show as one of the best reads in 2018.

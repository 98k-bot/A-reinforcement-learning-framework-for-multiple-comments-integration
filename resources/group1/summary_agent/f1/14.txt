I loved this book and it is a story of love and loss and coming on the other side stronger and wiser. The characters are very believable and this was the first novel by this author but was written like a seasoned writer. I appreciated the wholesome way she chose to write this love story, but if she gives in to the pressure to write smut I will no longer be a fan. Recommend to anyone who loves romance novels with unexpected plot twists and turns, bravo, a must read. I wish I could give this book four stars, but the legal real estate parts are so wrong that I can not get past it. This pleasant and very predictable little romance tells how a young woman, Sara, uncovers the history of her mother and grandmother, Mags. The story changes point of view back and forth between chapters, alternating between Sara and Mags story. This did not work well for me, because there is almost no difference between the voice like perspectives, ideas, motivations, speech patterns of the two women.

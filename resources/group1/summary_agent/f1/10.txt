Having known a few former operators and many current contractors, it just does not feel right to me. Motivations for key characters seem to be based on past experiences as victims, as if only victims can have passion in their endeavors. Worth the read as a free book, but glad I did not pay for it. There are no good guys, just a group of murderers who ply their craft and try not to be victims themselves. Long, boring passages are inserted between the evil versus evil shootouts, disappointing. This book would have been better in a condensed version.

Filthy language, do not buy, I bought it by accident, thinking that it was a good book and find a good book to buy and read instead of this trash. My fault for forgetting to check. I did enjoy the psychological part of this story so that part I would rate a five. I felt there was not enough background on a few characters, so that rated a three and then there was the awful feeling of the ending. If this is the way the author writes her books I am really not sure if I would be inclined to read another. I did not buy the basic premise, so the rest of the book failed to interest me. With everything that the husband had going on in the garage, there should have been some odors, blood, excessive noises, just totally unbelievable. And, in this day and age, how can anyone get children into schools without proper documentation and medical record. These inaccuracies really bothered me to the point that I spent more time wondering about them than the plot.

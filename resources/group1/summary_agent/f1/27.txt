Exceedingly important for us to know about and remember, especially given the current conditions in the United States. This is a massive tome, over nine hundred pages, well researched and lovingly written. I had never heard of Alain Locke before, but his accomplishments were profound. Hailed as the architect of the Harlem Renaissance, he gained degrees in philosophy from Harvard and was the first African American Rhodes Scholar, full disclosure. I did not read this book from cover to cover, and would not have chosen it had I known its ponderous size unlike its subject who was quite diminutive. However, I give this book highest marks because of the quality of that which I did read, its bringing to attention the life of someone so important, and the value it would have for a researcher of African American history. Alain locke father earned a law degree, ten years after the emancipation proclamation, a degree useless in most of segregated America.

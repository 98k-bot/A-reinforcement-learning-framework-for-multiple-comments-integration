I usually read most books that involve medical school and then experiences after graduation and I am a retired family nurse practitioner and I really miss the experiences I had with all my patients. I thoroughly enjoyed my career and enjoy books that accurately depict the facts. This memoir is sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes his faith is so strong, but just like most people it does falter. I was blessed by Walker and his amazing faith in God, especially his witness and prayers with his patients in the ICU. If you were facing surgery or had a loved one hanging in the balance it goes without saying, you would want such a doctor to attend to your care. His documentation of ways he has witnessed God intervention is inspiring and refreshing.

I think the only thing that could make this book any better is if it came with CD of all the musical examples. I have only read the first two chapters and a lot of things have become clearer for me. I would not say this book is very the absolute novice, but if you have some theory and knowledge of your instrument as an intermediate player, you will gain a lot from working through this book. It would help to be able to read both treble and bass clef such as a piano player does but it is not an absolute must. I am a guitarist and theory is theory and a great book to buy, it does not disappoint and it will not leave you scratching your head and tossing it to the side out of frustration. My significant other is an excellent classical pianist and has wanted to learn jazz piano for a long time.

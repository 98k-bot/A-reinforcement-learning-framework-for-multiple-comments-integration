I visited Northern Ireland as a psychologist. I had been working with families of murder victims, and had the chance to learn about the differences between street violence in America and political violence in Northern Ireland. Nothing prepared me for what I found. This book is the best book I have read about the reasons for, and impact of, political violence in Ireland. It goes deeper into the minds and lives of operatives than anything I have read and it is terribly sad, and it is chillingly detailed. This is truly one of the finest pieces of investigative reporting and narrative nonfiction I have ever read. One other thing is that, this book provides a warning for those in America who ever consider the use of paramilitary violence to achieve extreme ends.

The book itself is well written and filled with interesting information. My main issues lies with the way it is marketed, or more accurately, what I perceived the book to be about. It is not a true crime book where we follow around detectives or amateur sleuths. More than anything, it is a modern history book about the troubles, their legacy, and a few key players during this time. The protagonist as a whole have a rather small part, despite what the description and the introduction would have you believe. Every time a new chapter started that introduced a new character and pushed the actual solving of the crime farther off, I found myself wanting to skim since I knew there was no way I was going to remember yet another name.

Readers should not expect a detailed story about the protagonist and the mother was abducted, she disappeared, the children were left alone. This family is a glue that helps bind the book, but there is so much, much more. The author did amazing research on all the characters and events of these troubled times, each account truly unbelievable, but you have to read, knowing that you will not remember most of what you read. This is a big, heavy book, crammed in every paragraph with the shame, poverty, violence, pain, stress, and loneliness that the Irish in Belfast experienced. The author does not preach and he simply gives an accounting.

I am an American psychologist and was involved in providing trauma treatment training in the early times. As I write this, the Americans of Irish is apologizing for accidentally killing a journalist during a recent demonstration. If you are seeking understanding of part, and only part, of the Northern Ireland equation, then you want to read this book. It is not an easy read and it probably should not be if it was intended to help make a difference. But with all the discussion on old history and current foreign policies, the reality of life of people involved in the conflict and trying to deal with it and their own decisions is seldom this well addressed. With sadness, I highly recommend this book.

This book was heart wrenching but I could not put it down. The extent that the Americans of Irish went to right, an enormous wrong, though probably necessary, was extreme and it is hard to pull back from what was done. Jerry Adams is a fascinating character and the ultimate chameleon. The taped histories were something I had never heard of. Amazing how that project went sideways and then wrong. I feel this is a must read and so important to understanding where the the Americans of Irish came from and where it ended up. Strangely that there is now a tenuous peace is amazing and hopefully will continue.

I bought this when it first came out and had not read a review on this. The book is a page turner for sure and it flips from one story to the next but comes back to tie it all together. I had not read any books on the Americans of Irish but remember it well growing up as a kid and hearing of a lot in the US but never really understood all the pieces until this book. Reading all this makes me think of how insanely difficult it must be for those that live in gang ridden inner city neighborhoods and I can not imagine.

The best histories are stories, as a nonfiction this reads more like a novel than a an account of actual events and real people. As the author says most Americans of Irish decent had a ambient awareness of the troubles and I was one of those. I can remember driving to work and hearing Bobby Sands had died and I learned much from reading this. I have been to Belfast and planning to be there again this summer and I will view it an entirely different perspective.

If you are skeptical about non fiction do not be, say Nothing begins in Northern Ireland with the kidnapping of a mother of ten children, covers an explosive revolution called the troubles, and follows a charismatic leader clandestinely orchestrating guerrilla warfare against British troops. Add a deep hatred of the Catholics by Protestant Loyalists, reciprocated by the Catholics who are demanding Ireland be united. Now add the story of two sisters willing to serve in the Americans of Irish, the stunning story of the Belfast Ten plus a puzzling connection to Boston University and you have got a page turner. I could not put this book down. Exquisite writing, incredible flow and the author masterfully connects all the pieces, excellent read and do not miss this book.

I read this book in only a few days I could not put it down and it is nonfiction but reads like a novel. The story is so personal in regard to the disappearance of a young mother and I was also captivated by the account of the price sisters how two beautiful young women became so radicalized. I ended up being torn about how I felt about Gerry Adam the lone survivor in my estimation. Wonderful book I would recommend it to anyone who is I interested in history but really even if you had no interest it will draw you in from the beginning to the end.

There is cruel, blood lust in Northern Ireland and everyone knows the Americans of Irish is responsible and the people that are involved are not held accountable. It is a place of treacherous, violent warfare, no mercy is shown for anyone. A mother of ten children is ripped from their arms, gone, never to her seen again, until bones are swept onto the shore, nothing to identify the person it could have been, except there is found a blue safety pin and her children know that the possibility of it being their mother is high. People involved on either side will never forget the trauma, the terror the violence. This book is extremely well written and if you want to know detailed facts, look no further, a wrenching true story.

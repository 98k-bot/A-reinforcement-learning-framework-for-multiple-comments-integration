This is not something I would normally read, but my friend Mindy and other friends raved about it, and having dived in yesterday. Here I am coming up for air on the other end of it, amazing story, written in an interview style, about an infamous rock band in the seventy, and the craziness and drama of the drugs, and relationships. Fascinating, beautiful, sad, real, and well worth the read and I can not wait to see the mini series on Netflix.

Taylor Jenkins Reid has slowly been picking up fans in the book world and her previous book, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, has become hugely popular recently. I am sure that there are a lot of people eagerly awaiting the release of her next book. Overall, I really enjoyed this novel and I found this novel to be immerse and a complete page turner. I loved the world that Taylor captured of the old music scene and I can not recommend this novel more.

You know that feeling when it seems like a book was written for you and you alone and that is how I feel about Daisy Jones and The Six. If you love rock music, you will love this book, guaranteed, beautiful, original, and will transport you back in time.

I have watched real life music documentaries from the past, and this one felt a lot like a real one, with interview from members of and others surrounding a fictional seventies rock group. The background of the characters was rather standard for the music scene including family issues, relationship issues, substance issues. Set against the background of trying to make it in the industry, starting out from playing in bars and clubs, getting noticed, and finally breaking through.

What a fun novel and seriously anyone who is a rocker or classic rock enthusiast will enjoy this throwback to the music scene in 1970. The author does not offer up anything particularly new but while reading this I had flashes. The author clearly had defined inspirations and therefore the results where fairly predictable, is it a love story. This book is a convoluted and complicated one just like all the best songs are and we will love and hate the characters in turn and all at once. I felt like I was reading a biography of a favorite band and I loved it.

Daisy Jones and the Six is written through interviews with Daisy and the various members of the band, providing an oral history of what their time together as a rock and roll sensation. This is a fast read because of the way the book is structured, and a clever way to tell a story. Although I did not feel like I knew any of the characters well because we only got to see snippets of each person, I did appreciate hearing a variety of perspectives of the same times and events, which rounded out the story.

I do not give out five stars often, but this book was so engaging it is hard to believe it is not based on a real band. The book has the feel of the movie as we enter their world with eyes wide open and full of innocence and promise. The writing is crisp and done in an interview format that one would think would bore the reader but instead puts you on the streets and lets you travel with them through their ups and downs. A very satisfying read that I have zero doubt will be a successful series when Amazon produces it next year.

Written in the style of a tell all about a famous band and breakup of the 1970, this novel is immediately interesting. The narrative is quite readable as we hear from about a dozen characters, including the precocious Daisy Jones, often getting the same event from different perspectives, as Daisy and The Six collide, unite and then split up.

This was just like the commitments on paper, only better and it reads like that movie where the camera keeps switching to another bystander in a small town with his or her opinion. Only in this case, it switches each time to someone else in the band or a spouse of a band member and it is like that the whole way throughout the book. While you would think that would make it scatty and an awkward read, it actually makes the whole thing more engrossing because you can not wait to see what the next person opinion or perspective is, real, raw, gritty, with some lovely moments throughout.

Basically, I loved this book and despite my dislike of alternative writing styles, I loved how this was presented almost like the transcript to one of those retrospective used to play. Quick jumps back and forth between different people to fill in the story, offering information and different points of view. It was really amazing at how well the story was able to be presented in this manner. Sadly, I also spent a good majority of the book thinking that this was the movie Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper should have made instead of yet one more remake of A Star is Born.

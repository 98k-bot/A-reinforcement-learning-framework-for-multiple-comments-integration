This is a cookbook, full of recipes and pictures of some of the prepared recipes, the game of thrones food. Each kingdom is represented with a menu of foods that would be eaten there. The author is a huge game of thrones fan and had every other book related to it. I have followed this series since the beginning and I have always been the one drooling over the delicious food I see them eating. I have tried many recipes, but this one far surpasses all the ones I have tried. So far, I have made a bit of everything, including breads, side dishes, main dishes, and desserts. I find I tend to use the original recipe more than the modern version, but it is great to have both options. I love the quality of the book, beautiful pictures of the dishes, the way they grouped the recipes by region, nicely put together. The recipes themselves, and the way you get two ways to make everything. It is a unique cookbook in that way, and served me well for a game of thrones dinner party. While in the game of thrones, there is a lot of food descriptions and moments at the table, but it is not exactly giving ingredient lists or techniques. The authors do not let that stop them, and have managed to delve into what amounts to medieval English cooking and modern English cooking, and find a strangely satisfying balance. So of the recipes are simple and look divine. Wish I had not waited so long to make this purchase. The research that has gone into it is truly impressive and fascinating. This cookbook is both a wonderful Game of Thrones tribute and a worthy cookbook in its own right. I would recommend this book to any game of thrones lover. It will not disappoint you.

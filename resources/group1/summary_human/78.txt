Bob Marley is to sing in a concert to foster peace in bitterly divided country. Several days before the event, there is an assassination attempt against the singer by eight gunmen. This historical novel follows the lives of the hit men, from their early days in Kingston, to that in Miami and New York. Given the hype, I am fairly disappointed by this book. There are no characters, rather every voice in the book is an archetype. You feel like you are dealing with types of people, rather than actual people, whose behaviors and attitudes are in commonly a blend of types. Each chapter of this book is a first person account. But because there are so many switches from politicians, to scared women, to gangster killers, I had to make an exhaustive, hand written list of who was who and who was what. Every one of the characters live in their own little self made or circumstantial hell, so be forewarned that this is not an easy read for this reason alone. The book is harsh, cold with core truths in your face. If you have knowledge about Jamaica and the history of the events, all previous reviews are accurate. Sometimes the author writes in almost a stream of consciousness which immerses one in the rhythms of the life in Kingston. Part history, part storytelling, part poetry, part philosophy, this book covers a twenty year sweep with humor, brutality, pathos, drama. You name it, this book has it. I got the audio version of the book and it was fantastic. It had multiple narrators. Super distinct voiced characters mixed into complex interwoven plot lines. Really eye opening even for someone alive during the time in which the story is set. I liked the story although I thought it was a little long. The dialogue was very, very difficult to read, understand, and then using it to permit one to track the story. A simple glossary of terms would have been most helpful to the reader, and to the flow of the story being told.

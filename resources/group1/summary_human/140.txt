After quite a while of reading this book, nothing happened. Maybe something was going to happen, but I am getting older and did not have any more time to wait for it. The premise seemed promising. But felt that the execution fell short on this one. There are times when dealing with the main character the story feels very disjointed. I never really felt compelling reasons to care about the characters. There are characters whose only purpose seems to be delivering exposition. There is heavy reliance on coincidence driving the plot. The plot was interesting enough to keep my interest over weeks of reading. I was not sure how it was going to all pan out. The mood of this book is very introvert, mainly focusing of the internal reflections of a Civil war survivor who for some unexplained reason becomes a kind of gatekeeper for aliens on the move through the galaxy. This strange plot is used as a background for reflecting on human nature and society. The first third of this book was entertaining. However the author became much too wordy. Too much detail and feelings rather than story. The author should learn to tell a story rather than demonstrate his descriptive writing. Everything that the main character saw, smelled, felt, and thought while walking was described in excruciating detail. I found myself skipping a lot of it in the last third of the book. The entire thing may have made an interesting novella, but that would have required a caring, skilled editor and a modest author.

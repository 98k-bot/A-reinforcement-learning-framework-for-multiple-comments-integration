This is a cliche love story, extremely boring, unimaginative and predictable. The characters are not well developed, without growth. The basic backgrounds are uninteresting and unconvincing. This book lacks the depth which can be summarized as that a bad married woman, philandering her husband, meets world famous rock star and they fall in love. The rest is just filler. The story line was all over the place and poor, especially the events that occur with the daughter. The sub plot completely ruin the book with too much sweetness not countered by the ugliness of the daughter. And, a bit unrealistic that a young rock star would fall for a middle aged woman. It seems that the author does not know how to write a romantic story or a thriller. The ending happened with a whimper, with a rush to tie up the loose ends. Without being proofread, there are numerous editorial mistakes or oversights and shoddy mistakes in plot. Very disappointing.

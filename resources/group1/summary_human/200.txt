This book is an incredible story of a young man Joh Low, a Malaysian con man, despite lack of contacts and experience, tricks the prime minister and his wife into thrusting him with a one billion dollar sovereign fund. He finally became a member of the world of the wealthy. This is a very readable account of an almost incredible financial fraud. The sums of money involved are mind blowing. And the fraud was massive in scale and the authors did a thorough job in researching. I could not put it down after the first couple of pages, which is likely not something to be proud of. The story is great, but the book meanders from first person views of the perpetrators to views of the author, too detailed and repetitive to listen to. Feels like it was written against a deadline, or out collaboration between the two authors. The book is simply a chronology of events told in a simple expository manner. The constant use of ahead of for the preposition before heightened the impression of reading, as a splashy newspaper column rather than a serious book. It was similar to reading a series of news articles. The book reads like a collection of somewhat disjointed articles glued together for the sake of presenting a larger narrative. Without riveting stuff, the authors employ the same formulaic structure chapter after chapter. So many people and names, skipping around locations, threads of the story, dates, makes it harder to follow. Overall this an average book about fraud and political graft in a developing country. It is an easy read if you want a little entertainment.

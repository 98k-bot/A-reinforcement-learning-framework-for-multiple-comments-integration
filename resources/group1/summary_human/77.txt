It is a beautifully written story about a set of twins, a boy and girl, separated while children, meet again decades later in their hometown in India, both of them broken people. The key to their conditions lies in the reason why they were separated. The book immerses the reader a lot in Indian culture which I enjoyed a lot. On the other hand, the main story is very universal, it could be set almost anywhere in the past century. There are many levels including the characters of their mother, aunt, grandmother and uncle with whom they live. The suspense is kept until the very end. The writing is very evocative. Written in a non linear sequence of events, this book truly frustrated me. After the first read, I understood it and if I were inclined to, I would read it a second time. The characters are vivid and distinct. The prose is near poetry. The beautiful descriptions make the book almost possible to forget the complicated lives. It is not an easy read, a bit like struggling with a daunting jigsaw puzzle. And, gradually, you discover a lovely and horrible picture you cannot forget. When I came to the last page I was stunned, and heartbroken to think that loving the wrong person could ultimately destroyed an entire extended family. I would recommend you persevere as it really is a very satisfying read.

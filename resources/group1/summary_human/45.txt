The book is filled with the unintended consequences of attempts to improve one lot in life. It has the capability to unravel our fate, plans and even change the future. It is actually a series of interlocking stories that blend one into the other. The author has a very special way of telling stories that weave different characters lives into a larger fabric. She also has a gift for depicting the way that time passes in a subtle and compact way. The characters are connected in surprising and unpredictable ways, woven together in intricate threads. Each of the richly depicted characters is working through their own challenges and seeking their own improvement and when the pieces of the puzzle come together. Writing flows so smoothly that I found the actual experience of reading the book a joy and could not put it down. Even weeks later events will pop into my head. Why is not this writer better know and more celebrated. This is a masterful work of fiction for its almost invisible skill and technique on wonderful storytelling, with rich insight in heart. A fast yet luxurious read and a lovely escape into a beautifully interwoven world. Highly recommended.

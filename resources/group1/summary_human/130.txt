This is a political novel with the intellectual level of middle school to high school, a story of an actor, Lorenzo, called upon to impersonate a prominent politician and who ends up much deeper than he bargained for. The book starts out light and comical, but it lost such two elements gradually. Finally we see how arrogant, immature, and xenophobic, but also a mimic, Lorenzo, transforms himself into a perfect one both in psychical and emotional level. The story line is interesting but very predictable and I guessed the ending less than midway through the book. In other words, the story is certainly interesting enough and the author pulls it off well, but by the standards of the speculative fiction, it is a pedestrian. I had read this book many years before but forgot it because it was not worth remembering. The hero is an ordinary schmuck who supposedly rises to greatness. While this book is the best I have read so far, I remain continually amazed at the quality and content of the books from that era. It clearly was a different time and mindset. It did not move me in any meaningful way, nor leave me with any new thoughts. If you just want a good read and are just looking for entertainment, I am sure you will enjoy the book. In reality, this book could easily exist outside the genre of science fiction, so readers who do not normally like science fiction might dig this book. It is an interesting and engrossing read through and through. I am not a big Heinlein fan but everything that I have read has been at least good or better and this is no exception. This book is more of a romp, with some stuff to think about just coming along for the ride.

This book continues the discussion started in the previous book but it spends a lot of time hypothesizing about humanity future. The author gives a thorough, thought provoking description of events from an Ebola outbreak in monkeys and delves into the possibility of it becoming transmitted across species to humans by air. The book has three parts. The first one tells about the first reported surges of Ebola. The second is about an epidemics of a fourth Ebola variety. The third part is about the writer trying to find out Ebola himself. The first half of this book is pretty interesting. But it lost steam about three fourth of the way through when they are trying to control the outbreak in Virginia. I am humbled by the amount and scope of documented research that goes into the creation of a work of this magnitude. However, if you want to learn anything about Ebola or viruses, I highly advise you search for another book since it has only about a total of five useful pages of information. The book is also written in a very immature fashion. And, there is a missing element in the wonders of technology and data that are coming every month. After reading, you will either be thankful that you will not be around when biological and technological algorithms take god place or you will spread the word to your kids and that this book is a must to prepare for the future. Overall, An enjoyable read, the author keeps it light with funny analogies and anecdotes. However, it tends to get rambling in some sections, sometimes repeating points. Definitely one of the most important books I have ever read. It brings together so many threads and ideas from philosophy to human society. If you are looking for a book that gives you the tools to think about how the future might look like, then you will love this book as much as I do.

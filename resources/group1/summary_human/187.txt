I think this book will benefit me for the rest of my twenties. The author brings up many important topics that I never considered. Many things about this book stand out to me. This book strikes the perfect balance of validation, inspiration, motivation, and reality check. I was constantly blown away at how amazingly put together this book is. I would one hundred percent recommend this to anybody. The author reminds us that twenty age is not a purgatory period before life begins. It is an opportunity to prepare for the life you desire to have as an adult. The way the author describes the twenties period really articulately describes what my daughter has been going through. The book provides lots of narratives for people to connect to and apply to their own lives. It absolutely applies to every aspect of our lives, especially those we worry about most often. The book also made me feel all warm and fuzzy and humble to know that all the issues I have been having are experienced by others too. The author does an amazing job of making it all seem perfectly normal. I believe honestly all of what the author says in this book is phenomenal and insightful. I think this book is a great guide to anyone post college. Either by giving you thoughts you agree with and see in yourself to change, or more perceptively helping you think about where you are going. And like every good book, this book helped me change my view on certain things like love and relationship. Though the downside this book made me scared, trying to do everything in your twenties feels daunting. This is a tremendous resource and I am so grateful I found it.

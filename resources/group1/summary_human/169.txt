This book gives so much clarity around how your sexuality works and why patriarchal influences have forced women to have incorrect information about their bodies and experiences. It was worth every minute. It takes an unspoken topic and breaks it down scientifically and without judgment. It is also gentle and supportive, and aimed at women who are dealing with emotional blockers in intimate or sexual relationships, and at their partners. The author encourages a kind, mindful, nonjudgmental approach to exploring sex. This books explains scientific concepts about arousal and orgasm in layman language, and constantly reinforces the concept that there is nothing wrong with us. We all have the same parts, arranged differently. I found the research and ideas illuminating and so encouraging. I am using a couple of the tools in the book and am excited where this journey is taking me. I am more aware now of the myths and negative info on women and their sexuality. I truly believe this should be a necessity in sex education classes for women. Even men could learn a lot from this book. It is worth being open to and giving a shot. The author leads her readers down a path of self realization and intimate personal growth. Take this, read this, make your partner read it. If I could, I would give this book more than five stars. This book lift me up and made me cry.

I found this book fascinating until I found that some pages were missing. On the cover are five distinct fingerprints of some kind of gross goo. Since the book takes place in the south with a heavy accent, the reading level proves to be elementary grade proficiency equivalent. Overall, the book was interesting, however not stunning since I was not interested in learning some of the back story. The characters were fun, but there were way too many to keep track of in some parts. The plot and story line were well written, but lagged a little in places. I know this book is fiction but the author had to have some good sense of observation to write such a thing and it makes me wonder if she had some engineering, biology or cytology background as well if she might have cracked this human problem and made a huge breakthrough. Much of the book is written in the idiomatic African American way of speaking which can be difficult to understand for those not familiar with it. The ending is a bit sad though and the vernacular makes me want to stab out my eyes. The story is heart wrenching and thought provoking, but I just could not get that excited about it.

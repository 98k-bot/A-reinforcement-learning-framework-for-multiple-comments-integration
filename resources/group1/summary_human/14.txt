This is an amazing and engaging story of love and loss, very pleasant and hilarious. The premise that Sara goes back to the old house pulls you effortlessly into the world you never want to leave, filled with gorgeous scenery. The characters like Sara and her eccentric grandmother Mags, are very believable, authentic and well developed, easy to be pictured. The New Orleans and Alabama setting can catch reader heart and attention. There are unexpected plot twists and turns. The layers of the book peel away, taking readers deep into emotional issues, however, the point of view changes back and forth between chapters and characters. Consequently, I have to keep flipping back. The author should have done a better job of learning the law, as the legal real estate parts are so wrong, making the plot fall flat. The author adds drama to the story but not detracting from good story. The ending is somewhat obvious and predictable. I appreciated author wholesome way to write this love story, without foul language or overt sexual scenes. An enjoyable reading, recommend to anyone who loves romance novels, a must read.

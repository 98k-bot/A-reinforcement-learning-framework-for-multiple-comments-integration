A book like this is always a page turner because we are curious as to how we would face impending death and therefore relish the opportunity to see it through the eyes of one who is experiencing this first hand. The surface story is the tragic death of a young physician with great potential who will never see the physical rewards of his labor, and in a larger sense, the loss for all of us who are to be deprived of his passion and skill. But I struggled to find the real emotion here. All I feel after reading this book is sad. A young man who worked so hard and had so much to offer, was only to have his end pointlessly in death, sad and frustrating. I think the author wrote above the average the head of the reader, not so much in his vocabulary but in his philosophic search for the meaning of death and what makes life worth living. I thought this book would have more revelations and insights about life and death than it did. So many people had recommended this book to me. The promise was a book that looked at the meaning of life from the perspective of someone with a very tragic situation and background. But never delivered. I just felt no emotional connection to the writer at all, and I am not sure why. The writing about the life is superb. however, the summary of the book I read on amazon led me to expect that the author found some deep philosophical thoughts on the meaning of life, or rather why we strive to stay alive. I found the book lacking in depth and lacking in answers. I was looking for something that went deeper to the very roots of death.

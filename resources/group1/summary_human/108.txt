I was not familiar with this authors work so I did not know what to expect. The title caught my eye, as being the subtitle of the classic nineteenth century novel. What I got was a delightful book, full of twist and turns that keep you solidly focused on the narrative. A great mystery book that will keep you avidly interested in the conclusion. The complexities of time travel, the inefficiency of the bureaucracy involved, the seemingly arbitrary nature of it all. The composition is excellent, the plot is delectable, and the imposition of historical and social mores is enlightening. I found the characters an interesting bunch, with a full cast of engaging characters, and a cat and a dog, and the protagonist is an appealing chap. The discussion of time slippage can get a little dense, but it does help to set up and then explain some the central mysteries in the book. The chapter headings got me, then the dialogue and then the essence of the book itself. It was hilarious, witty, full of mystery and great set pieces. The ending feels a bit rushed, like some weddings that I have participated in. I did realize that perhaps wishing we had done or said something different is a ridiculous waste of time, we can not possibly extrapolate from the point of change to the present time with any hope of accuracy. The writing is intelligent and outright hilarious at times. This was a fast, enjoyable and rollicking read. I will be finding more of this author work.

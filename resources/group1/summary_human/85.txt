This is an excellent novel that I suggest everyone read at least three times. It is a tale of revolution, politics, history and understated heroes. The author was a great thinker and writer. This book promotes civic nationalism, though maybe because the moon had no indigenous people and all the colonists apparently have managed to intermarry. The story is written first person by a resident of the Moon with an accent. I found the vivid descriptions of a possible life on the moon fascinating. The idea of a computer come to life is not that alien to us now but the character development was constantly interesting. I now fully understand the Hugo award status. Though a bit long, the action and the story line kept going. This is not only full of action and realistic characters, it is literature in the classical sense. I liked this book as a kid and as an adult. If you like to pick up a book and read for hours at a time, this one has the action to keep you turning those pages. I have just spent an enjoyable few days rereading an old friend. It is a bit like being an earthworm never truly being able to enjoy a rainbow. It is a great book to measure all others in the genre. I am never disappointed.

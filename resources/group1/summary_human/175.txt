This is a helpful and encouraging book and a must read for homeschooling and full time moms. It has some really good ideas and checklist if you are desperate for help getting life in order. You feel as though a friends has encouraged you in a honest and gentle way to remember why you are a mom and gave you practical advice on how to keep doing it well. This book is so good. I am having so many amazing moments. I have not been able to get through other books about introverts without getting bored and putting them down forever. Seriously, I have never read a book so quickly. The author took the words, heart, realities right out of the pages of my own introverted life. The author gives some good tips on how to get the breaks you need when you are home all day with children. The author gives moms permission to identify the introverted tendencies and shows how to protect the peace while using the strengths which come from their God given personalities. It gave me permission to be myself and not feel defeat and failure at the end of every day. This book is more about the grace for you. I think that is why I loved it so much. The finishing touch on an already excellent book is the sections the author includes on her favorite literary introvert mentors. Best of all, I have a new literary mentor to turn to. Maybe we are both too introverted to ever meet up outside of the internet and the pages of a book. I highly recommend this book to any introverted woman. Whether homeschooling or not. It is a breath of fresh air. Encouragement to your spirit and soul.

This book was phenomenal and has everything, great writing, superb psychological mystery, realistic and excellent characters development with intense feelings, exceptional plot, a non stop story line with plenty of twists and turns and a satisfying ending to captivates your attention. I knew nothing else about it and that served me well as I did not know there was a big surprise twist coming. The criminal psychotherapist is determined to crack the case that is the silent patient. Once all is revealed it is a jaw dropping, heart stopping revelation that rocks you to the core. I was unable to predict the ending. I was keeping track of each introduced suspect and made note of peculiar details that the author included with my mouth hanging open when I found out exactly who did done it. The book is a fast read, well written, exciting, and offers a surprising ending that is clever and believable. What a wonderful story, well played and you got me. If I could give this book more than five stars I would. I highly recommend. I can not wait for the next book by this author.

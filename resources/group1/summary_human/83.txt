When I downloaded this series to my kindle before leaving on a long European adventure. Many people I know love these novels and the subsequent movies. Personally, I cannot see why. The writing is incredibly juvenile and weak. The concept was interesting, but the execution was poor. I found nothing compelling about the lead female. This book is bad. So much potential. The inner goddess is annoying. It is not sexy. I had never intended to read the book for any reasons. What surprised me was how boring it was. There was no plot and the dialogue was silly. I did not find it sexy at all and certainly not romantic. When all is said and done, it is not the subject matter that I find offensive. It is the bad writing. The author flushes every paragraph, and not a toilet in sight. Holy crap. The list of dumb, repetitive expressions goes on and on. I guarantee that you will get really tired. I was disappointed. Ridiculous plot, and no depth to the characters. I mean the lack of writing skills demonstrated by this author is nothing short of astounding. It reads like a cheap romance novel where the maiden is always a virgin, gorgeous. The author uses certain things like cocking the head sideways, and many other repeats too many times. This book could have been written by a teenager using a dictionary. This was a waste of my money. If you are interested in this topic, there is much better reading available.

I still have not seen the movie. I am wondering how they made this movie anywhere accurate. All and all I enjoyed Life of PI. I skimmed through it. I found it to be a charming, well written piece. The story that was told after the sinking of the ship was moving. The end was interesting and it will make you think about the whole journey again. The story is not boring by any means, just like one of the characters listening to the story has to make a choice. The author leaves this question open for the interpretation of the reader. Ultimately I believe the whole purpose of the book was to reinforce that life emanates from a supreme creator. That is a nice trick, but in itself does not make it a masterpiece of inquiry into human nature. However it took me a while to get into it. The first part to me was long and I kept waiting for the real story to start which happens in the second part. The plot was fascinating, the writer kept the story flowing. But the descriptions of each animal being killed in more detail, over and over throughout the story. I think the spiritual element is present and the descriptions are particularly lyrical. I was very pleasantly surprised by the amusing and clear eyed approach to religion and I also admired the realistic description of both physical and psychic pain during the long tribulations. All in all, if you like background knowledge, you will probably not fall asleep during the beginning like I did. If you like action more, try watching the movie and then reading the book.

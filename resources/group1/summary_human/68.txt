It is no surprise this book won a Pulitzer Prize. This book grabbed my attention from the first page. It is well researched and well written and tells us that we have already lighted the match and have started a fire in the barn that is our planet. The author in this book travels the world visiting various spots on the globe that are on the front line of what she calls the extinction. The result is an interesting and somewhat depressing travelogue of the state that our planet is in. The author illustrates the future of extinction by illuminating the history of extinction. Probably not the main takeaway from this book intended, but that is what I learned. Sometimes intentionally as in the now numerous extinct bird and large mammal species that disappeared right after humans arrived. One of the things I found most compelling are the profiles, both of animals that are extinct and at risk, as well as the scientists of the past and present dedicating themselves to our planet. I feel the book ended rather abruptly and could have included a more thorough examination of where we should go from here. The examples cited throughout the book help us paint a picture of probable events reaching back to through five major extinctions and the strong possibility that we are headed towards. We are neither the fastest or the strongest or the largest. Just smart enough to kill ourselves off with over population, pollution, nuclear technology and on and on. As it is, the book slapped me into ecological consciousness but then did not show me what I needed to do now that I am awake. This one should be mandatory reading for all the rest of us who vote for them.

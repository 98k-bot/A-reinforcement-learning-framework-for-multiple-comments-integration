This is a story of forgiveness. The deep understanding of each real character carried me through to the end. The story line is very interesting with romance atmosphere. The pace and rhythm are soothing and comforting, with hope and despair presented in relationships. The reader may begins to put the puzzle in progress, not until the final chapter do all the pieces come together. Although the story will have you laughing or weeping, throughout the entire story the beauty and joy of various types of love will enchant you and make you think. The descriptions are so lyrical and vivid, you could just envision the surroundings so clearly. A Sea of Memories is the perfect title and my eyes have been opened to see and notice and appreciate the love I have in my life. I love this delightful book, looking forward to reading more from author. Once you understand, the lessons of life they leave behind become valuable gifts for your future. This is one of the best books I have read this year. Highly recommend.

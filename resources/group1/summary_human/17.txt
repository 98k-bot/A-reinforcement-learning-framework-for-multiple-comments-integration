This book is a waste of my money and time, Trash. Although I enjoy the psychological part of this story, the plot itself seemed flawed throughout, a bit too overboard. The premise sounded intriguing and I did not develop any sympathy. I was hoping for more action early on to keep me engaged. So much of the story did not add up at all. These inaccuracies really bothered me to the point that I spent more time wondering about them than the plot. The main character was so paranoid without enough background that I was getting nervous. Got tired of reading about all the crazy precautions. It was difficult for me to accept a person who was that stupid as the lead character. I did not care for how it was written either and the rest of book failed to interest me. I figured out who the new bad guy was going to be within the first one third of the book. Most of the story was predictable and cliche. The ending is of an awful feeling, nothing but a cliff. So that rating is a two. This author is not for me and I disliked the book so much. Quite a disappointment and not recommend.

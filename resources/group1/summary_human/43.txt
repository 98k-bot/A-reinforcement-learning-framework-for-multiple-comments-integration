I really disliked this book. The premise showed promise, but the rest of the book never made much sense. This story just droned on with slow paced. There is little character development, the plot falls flat. The sub plots do nothing to support the actual plot. The compelling concept was better than the execution. The author tries hard to provide hints to the mystery but very little pay off. The chapters are very short and we constantly alternate personality between various characters but nothing is really happening. It jumps from one character to another but not giving away much. What a waste of time reading this mess. It is an annoying read since everyone is a suspect and too dramatic. I think the author must fancy herself, with the endless descriptions of the intricacies of flower arranging. The ending killed the story in my opinion. The resolution comes out with zero foreshadowing. It almost seems to be a novella that has been fluffed and stuffed in order to be made book length. You find yourself turning the pages, but not in an excited way. I chose only a one star rating because it was extremely dragged out and dull, just boring.

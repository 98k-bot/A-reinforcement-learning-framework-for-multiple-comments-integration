The author has thoroughly arrived to offer a clear evaluation of how Trump became President, what that may mean for the immediate future, and why his presidency was necessary to unseat the old established order. The author is a brilliant observer who writes with the long view of politics and government of a classical historian to put the Trump Revolution into perspective, with the ability to make perfect descriptions of the subject from many supportive angles. The book is not a propaganda defense of Trump, but an analysis of the campaign so far, viewed from a top the shifting sands of American political landscape behind the persona. That is why I think the author did in explaining objectively how this outside Trump with no political experience or backing. The opposition to Trump is extremely misguided and false and the facts laid out in this book prove it. A Must read for those who wish to understand why Trump is needed, now more than ever. Highly recommend, fascinating and calming read.

My main issues lies with the way it is marketed, or more accurately, what I perceived the book to be about. It is not a true crime book where we follow around detectives or amateur sleuths. More than anything, it is a modern history book about the troubles. This is the best book I have read about the reasons for, and impact of, political violence in Ireland. It goes deeper into the minds and lives of IRA operatives than anything I have read. It is terribly sad. And it is chillingly detailed. The author did amazing research on all the characters and events of these troubled times, each account truly unbelievable. A wrenching true story. Exquisite writing, incredible flow. The author masterfully connects all the pieces. If you are seeking understanding of part of the Northern Ireland equation, then you want to read this book. It is not an easy read and it probably should not be if it was intended to help make a difference. It is nonfiction but reads like a novel. I was also captivated by the account of the price sisters how two beautiful young women became so radicalized. I feel this is a must read and so important to understand where the IRA came from and where it ended up. Strangely that there is now a tenuous peace is amazing and hopefully will continue. The book flips from one story to the next but comes back to tie it all together. I highly recommend it.

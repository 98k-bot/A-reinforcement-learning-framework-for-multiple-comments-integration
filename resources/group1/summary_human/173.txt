The author knows that those who open their hearts can be changed and follows the first and second commandments. This book is more about the gospel and I started reading and could not put it down. A man who speaks the truth is a rarity in this day and age. The author has fortitude and exemplifies a real man. Admits when he has made mistakes and clearly loves God, Family and the United States. This book will give you a very real look into what life is really like once you give yourself to Christ and the statutes of Scripture. I promise there is nothing in here that will not prove to be your own story once you have. The author believes with all his mind, heart, and soul in the God of the Bible and talks to us as adults. He has a strength of faith that guides his decisions. He frames this entire book through the lens of his faith and reveals in plain spoken, commonsense text. Fortunately, the author found freedom and forgiveness in Christ Jesus, which drastically changed his life. His temperance is calming and this books reads as if you can hear him speaking to you. The author gave a powerful heartfelt talk on the direction of our country and the peril we are facing as America continues to turn from God. I read his book in a few hours and recommend it highly.

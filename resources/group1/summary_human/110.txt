So many events transpire throughout the story. I laughed several times throughout. I thought it was a little wordy in parts, but overall an enjoyable story. It is my first book by this author, but it left me wanting to read more from her. I thoroughly enjoyed the well developed characters and plot. I liked the good characters morality, and the level of the immoral characters was sufficient for their dastardly acts. A sugary treat. More please. The character Miranda is one of those ladies where it is hard for her to control her emotions and the man she loves can see her in a way no one else can. She understands that it is hard for her to keep her spitfire temper in check. Unlike some other Regency novels, the ensuing relationship is true to life while the author focuses on maintaining a clean story line. Although we knew from the beginning who the love interests would be I found some things surprising along the way. I actually got to one point in the story and thought it was now time to wrap up the love story and it would all be over. This book was unexpectedly funny and entertaining in a way that made it impossible to put it down. The pace is perfect and the story is full of intrigue, great dialogue, mystery and enough romance to melt the heart. The plot was wonderfully executed. I could not put this book down. From punches thrown, to mistaken identities, and all the lady like lessons a woman could need. This novel will keep you reading until the very end and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who likes an adventure and romance story. I am definitely giving it five stars.

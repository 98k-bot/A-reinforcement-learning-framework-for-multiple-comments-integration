This is an intriguing story about the spiritual journey and growth of a doctor, Dave Walker, and his mission to ask for God help in healing the critically ill people. Dave Walker felt called to devote his live to patients in need to truly be a good doctor. This memoir, more like vignettes with life lessons than a traditional biography, is sometimes heartbreaking and the character faith in God is so strong, especially his witness and prayers with his patients in the ICU. I was inspired by Dave Walker lifestyle, insights, the ways he has witnessed God intervention as well as many examples to trust God to continue ministry to hospice with prayer. This book is a a great reminder to never give up asking God to heal, even if not all get healed in the way we hope. The book never dragged and I thoroughly enjoyed the authenticity that every ending was not a fairy tale. The story accurately depicts the facts as well as the emotional impact of medicine when dealing with the sick and I highly recommend.

This book won a Hugo award. The story is about a brother, a sister and their closest friend, growing up in very unusual times, a science fiction without much science. It is a mysterious membrane that encloses planet earth, cutting of our view of the stars and planets. The Earth is wrapped in a time distortion field. Figuring out the nature of the spin and why it happened is the crux of the book, although it could be wired. The characters are very one dimensional and do not grow over time. The main character acts in the same way at the start as he does at the end. A little more than half way through the novel starts to lose steam. The plot starts to unravel and characters began not to ring true as they had in the first half. Excellent backdrop and many great concepts and ideas as the setting for the novel. Sadly, it struck me as a brilliant short story that had been padded out to something the length of War and Peace, like stars in the sky separated by parsecs of void. There were so many cliff hangers that I thought I was reading a soap opera. Even worse is when the characters act contrary to their nature just so they do not learn information which they would then impart to the reader. The author did a fine job at building the character persona, but the story was ineffective at best, totally boring at worst. It is a stretch to believe that an intelligence that can bend space and time over a period of billions of years did not develop the communication skills. I really like the writing style and enjoyed the humor of the author, but a lack of actual plot movement kills this one.

This book has the content that you will not see or find anywhere else. It is put together with so many far left leading news stories as being able to support the fact of what happened. The book does an excellent job of making sense of all the conflicting and often fake media reports. And the author presents facts, events and time lines in a compelling and generally even handed way so you can draw your own. Everyone should go to appendix section one to three to further understand the leaks to the media and the connections that put this entire president scandal on the map. This book goes through all the players names so you can understand their role in the greatest scandal in American history. Anyone who listens to broadcast and watches show of the author everyday knows how much work he put to tell the real story and back it up with solid facts. The detail is incredible. This book sheds light on the deep corruption in our government and how far these corrupted individuals are willing to go to maintain power by any means necessary using the full weight of the media. This book makes everything simple. The results are, in equal measure, distressing and impressive. The only thing the good guys need to do is write up the indictments and prosecute the criminals. I urge all to read this with an open mind and a critical eye.

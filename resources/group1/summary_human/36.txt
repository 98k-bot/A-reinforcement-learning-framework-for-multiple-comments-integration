It is a fascinating story of an amazingly strong and brilliant women who painstakingly recorded her life which presents the realities of the practice of polygamy from the perspective of prominent Mormon family and its impact. This book is such an eye opening account that a woman would be so brave as to take on the church, very remarkable and compelling reading. I was struck by the fact that readers have expressed their appreciation of Fanny Stenhouse. As a human being I can certainly understand the terrible suffering that one person can bring on another. Spoke in modern language, the reader can get an honest, unflinching and painful story from the author life and the sorrow and heartbreak caused by degradation. The story is a must read. In some ways this book confirmed suspicions. Highly recommended for those who researched the early years of this Mormonism religion.

This book would make a good introduction for someone who does not know much about China. It is beautifully written, nuanced and focused on interesting individuals. The author narratives provoke reflection about which form of governance is most suitable for not only China, but also the US. However, the book is written as if the author is trying to get it through the communist party censors. It rambles around from story to story. I felt disappointed by a lack of conclusion. I was hoping for a book that would entertain me and explain the rapid changes in China I have witnessed firsthand. This book is just too boring and fragmented to accomplish the task. It dragged on for way too long. The stories in the book are nothing new to me as a Chinese. I found some of the stories not objective and comprehensive enough. The title of the book is misleading. This book is not stories of ordinary Chinese chasing their dreams in an age of ambition, but a who is who of famous Chinese dissidents. It gears towards mild sensationalism. Tends to pander towards American notions of identity, freedom, and individualism. It essentially was formatted in a manner that resembled a compilation of non fiction short stories that the author either uncovered from research or from interviews. It did not keep my attention as one solid piece of work. In the humble opinion of this reviewer, I found this book heavily peppered very useful insights.

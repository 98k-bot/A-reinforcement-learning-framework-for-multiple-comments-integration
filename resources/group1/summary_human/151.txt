Excellent book, references and examples throughout the book. I am so pleased with this purchase I had to immediately review. This book is a worthwhile book to read if you consider yourself an independent thinker. The author shines a very bright light on this aspect of our society and how it has slid into the mess as it is today, with insight on different topics and more. It talks about how our media is a big propaganda machine for the left and how it got that way. Well written and drawn from many sources, the author explains the emergence of partisan media and how destructive it has become. The author has spent a lot of time in the research phase of this writing. He expertly illustrates how important the press was in shaping early America and what lead to the revolutionary war, a fight for liberty, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. He also points out that a free press is important in preserving our constitutional republic. It is so sad to read how some of the biased media manipulate and spin events to suit their own narrative. The book is just sitting out on a table or nondescript area begs for attention. I read this book while nodding my head up and down so many times that my chin is sore. I could not put this book down. The premise of this book is well known to all conservatives. It reads more like an excellent novel.

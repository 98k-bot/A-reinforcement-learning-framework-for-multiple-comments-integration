I am so glad I flipped through before giving to my son to read. I ended up tossing the book away to trash. Most of the content was pretty disturbing to me. It is one of the most trite poetry I have ever read, and exemplifies zero skill of poetic craft. I was disappointed after I had read it and it reads like a bunch of text messages, a myriad of social media posts. This book proved that you can write down whatever random thought and call it poetry and that is fine. For the whole book, many poems fall short of expectations, especially those that are literally a couple of sentences, like the unedited journal entries with recycled quotes and wisdom that occasionally got insightful. Without a lasting impression, this book does not evoke emotions for me. On the real, it is not worth the money, depressingly lacking a resemblance to true poetry. Do not buy this.

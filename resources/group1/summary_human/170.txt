This book is a page turner. For those of us that remember the events of 911, it will take you back to that time in quite a bit of detail. A really hard read if you were alive during 911. Scary, heartwarming and tragic, all at the same time. The victims, survivors and heroes all stand out in this meticulously researched book. I still remember falling to the floor in front of my television and sobbing alone endless nights after everyone was asleep over the loss of all those innocents. This book is ably researched and paints vivid pictures. The author does give us a time line because it does perhaps lend a layer of authenticity. This book is riveting and I did not want to put it down even though it is necessarily graphic at times. The author points out many issues that I had not heard previously. Within minutes, I was acutely aware that this was not simply a narrative history but an exposition of tragedy unmatched in modern times. This is not merely stirring memory but a reanimation of human beings in full, as much unknowing as the reader is knowing. The deeply intimate story of what happened that fateful day, serves to introduce us to people whom we have never met and forget. The author has shared with us their lives before and during, and in some lucky cases, after that cataclysmic day. If you want to understand what it was truly like for the people who died and survived, this is the one of those books that are read over a lifetime. Highly recommend.

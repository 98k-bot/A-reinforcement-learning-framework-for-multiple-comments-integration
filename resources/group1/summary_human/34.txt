This book, a little uneven, has been recommended by several established jazz guitar players and I am already hooked. The book covers a lot of territory with very nice melodic ideas inside. I have only read the first two chapters and a lot of things that seems to be obscure have become clearer. I have spent many evenings a week learning the various scales and chords, why and how the music differs from others. Author explanation sometimes making my head hurt, ultimately makes sense, and helped me make sense of the other materials. Take it slow, a page or two a day is plenty. You will gain a lot with some theory and knowledge of your instrument. It quickly demystifies jazz and exposes the logical workings behind the music, igniting my desire to play. It is excited to go through this book, formatted beautifully and laid out in a common sense fashion, one of the best written by one of the best. A worth read for the excellent presentation.

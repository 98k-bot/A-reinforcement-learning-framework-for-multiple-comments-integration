This book is fun, thoughtful, and has a great ending. A great way to break into the writings of author. Since this book was on sale, and the description of a ship where the new crew members keep dying was intriguing to me, I purchased it. The novel is clever and humorous, with elements of parody and metaphysics, the Hugo award for best novel. It is a fast paced and hilarious novel about the expendable ensigns of a ship in a star world. The premise tells you all you need to know about the darkly hilarious tone of this book, and that same tone dominates what happens to the characters throughout. What an amazing book this is. It is unlike anything I have ever read before, and possibly unlike anything that will come again. The story grabs you from the first page and you are helpless. You can not put it down until you are done. There are the three codas. Think of them as unnecessary to the plot of the book, but it is almost like bonus material. I can not rate it perfect because I found the three codas to be a bit too long for my liking and it dragged on a bit after what felt like the climax of the book. Aside from that, I really enjoyed it. Be patient, and try to be introspective from time to time while reading it. I will recommend it, but for adults only, kids just will not get through the frustration.

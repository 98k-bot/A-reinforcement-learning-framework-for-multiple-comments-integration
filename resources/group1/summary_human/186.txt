The authors were brilliant and really shook up the fields of economics and psychology with their work. However, if you are approaching this material for the first time, this is not the easiest way to get into the depths of their research. While this book is more approachable than their original research papers, it is more challenging than other books that cover the same material. As a result it took quite a while to plow through it and I enjoy this kind of stuff. This book is good in describing the different portions of the mind and how the influence thinking and decision making. My real complaint with the book is that the points could have been made in a couple hundred less pages. One of the main weaknesses of the book is ironically the fact that the book does not have much of a discussion of the nexus between these behavioral biases and economics. There is also little discussion on the impact of the contents of the book on the prevailing economic theories. The examples provided are thought provoking and interesting, but this book is long and repetitive to me. It is great to know so many theories about decision making, but all are not actionable and may not be useful for me as a manager. The premise is sound but the foundations could have been much more concise and to the point. When I finished I was impressed by all the research, but left wondering how all this research could make my life any better.

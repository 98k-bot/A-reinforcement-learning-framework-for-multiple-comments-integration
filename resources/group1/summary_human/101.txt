This book was a lot better than I thought it would be. I went in with extremely low expectations. Somehow though, it ended up being, so far anyway, one of my favorite reads of the year. Could not put it down. There are some great lessons to be learned here and also a beautifully written, captivating story line. The ending left me with a bit of whiplash at how quickly it just dropped off and was over. I have read the book twice. It is a young adult fiction book, but the writing is such that it sparks memories of being in that age group. I thought the writer did an excellent job with spoon feeding the details to make the reader smart. I am so glad I kept going, because this is actually a very well crafted novel that deals with a lot of interesting issues surrounding life and death. I will say that this book was amazing and if you have not read it then you need to. It also made me think of ground hogs day but more morbid since the character ends up dying. What I love about the book is the character got the chance to learn from her mistakes. She learned to accept people and understand them including herself. It was such a great read and definitely kept me engaged. I was hoping the end would be different but understood there could not be another ending. I just wish there could have been a glimpse of how the other characters dealt with the situation. When I was not reading it, I was trying to figure out what came next. None of the story was predictable, and not the end either. This novel has changed my perspective on life. That is no small thing. It has changed the way I view my life. I would highly recommend this book. Very good writing.

This is by far one of the best books well written by the author. It broke my heart while making it whole. First, it is an important historical document. Second, there is no denying the power and passion in his prose. It speaks to anyone and everyone who is ready to listen. The author points out so many relevant and truthful aspects of race, oppression. More importantly, he goes a step further to suggest ways to improve society as a whole. The reflections are very thoughtful as the author swims deep in topics of black self identity, religion, American white supremacy. The life experiences and thoughts as a Black man of his time sadly mirrors those of today. I truly loved the analysis and opinions of the Negro problem in America. The writing is clear, direct and powerful. The author states home truths on race directly, baldly, and wisely. What burns in this essay is the deadwood of racism and the rotten fencing unconsciously preserved to keep one safe from the other. The author writes of this incendiary process not as an abstraction but as a vivid lode of everyday experience. And, he is a first class rhetorician, a natural, and his diction is pitch perfect. This book was simply excellent and amazing. The words in this book are utilized in a way that make you feel as though you are within the story. So if this is a subject that interest you please pick this book up. I recommend it to absolutely everyone.

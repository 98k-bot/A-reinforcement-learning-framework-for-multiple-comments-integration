This is a collection of short stories. Every single story is heart wrenching and made me think. As time went on, I felt that I was able to get so many different perspectives of the experiences of those who served in Iraq. The train of thought of the characters was completely realistic. I had no idea this book would stimulate the first serious nightmare I have had in years. It was not just the artfully crafted stories but the subliminal tripwires that rekindled events from my Vietnam experience, no happy ending, just truth. The author chose to tell multiple stories from several different angles or perspectives. The writing is crisp and direct and feels genuine. If profanity offends you, try to get past that so you can inhabit these characters. Some are heroic, some are flawed, but there is humanity in them all. I enjoyed the writing but felt he left too much to the reader to understand with military jargon, and that he missed an opportunity to explain some of the Iraqi culture and how they perceived things. The author in particular focuses on reintegration of the military service member back into the civilian world. This book is fantastic, and deserves to win each award it has been nominated for. I highly recommend. Every story tugged at my heart in some way. Overall, it is disturbing, unplugging, exciting, thoughtful, depressing and overwhelming wrapped in a realism that I can not ignore. A very good book.

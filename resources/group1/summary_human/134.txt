The novel follows five different story lines in a sort of slice of life fashion. Most story lines are slow and really have very little payoff in their resolution. This book is entertaining at times, but it is so exasperating to follow the story as the author uses more phrases than complete sentences and then writes what the characters think before what they actually say. All the characters are interlaced through common elements such as frequent references for predictions about the future and many of the characters reading the same novel within the novel. The premise is intriguing, but I did not care about any of the character and whenever one got into a tense situation. The technique of this author leaked all the tension out of it. By the end of the book, it just felt like the author got sick of writing the book and suddenly just decided to end it without any sort of resolution of any kind. There were many nice tidbits like this brought up throughout the book, but ultimately they seemed to be tangential to the main thrust of the story. This book is excruciatingly slow and pointless. So incredibly mundane and boring. I refuse to donate this book to Goodwill, as I would not want to subject anyone else to reading this horrible crap. It was hard to follow several of the story lines because of the way the author wrote, but I was still interested until the very end where the ending seriously angered me. I felt as though I had wasted my time reading the book. A fantastic idea for a book, but an insufficient, inadequate, and disappointing ending. I love science fiction, but this alternate history is a slow read.

This book has two major flaws. This book has virtually no description on real whole wheat breads and real nutrient value and fiber in them. Another major failure is baking at high elevations over three thousand feet. The most annoying thing is that the directions for the recipe are on the back side of the page with the ingredients so, lots of flipping back and forth. Also, the pages are flimsy. The ingredients lists are almost impossible to read. So I have had to write them out so I can read while making the bread. I have made some recipes from this book and I have not been thrilled with the results. The interesting one day breads are okay. But the more advanced breads have caused me many problems. I should have thrown them out right then, but I took a chance on baking them, hoping that they would puff up. I guess I will toss this book. I would not recommend this to anyone. This a great book for someone with zero experience with any type of breads, but terrible for someone with some knowledge. This book is too heavy for the light binding the publishers have given it because it is loaded with illustrations on high quality paper. When going through this book to understand recipes, I cannot trust the measurements and do not know if the editors were consistent or not in differentiating weight from volume. The set up of the book is maddening. Instead of being organized by type of bread you are baking, it is organized by how difficult or challenging the bread is to make.

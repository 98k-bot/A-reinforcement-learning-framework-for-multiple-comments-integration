What a sad book and a fascinating read. I felt so sorry for the Clutter family. A good, mid western, solid and stable farm family. I hated to put it down even to sleep. Still, it went quickly. The author painted such a full picture of the two killers, both quite clearly mentally ill. The book conveys the time period to us and the character of these men and to a certain extent their victims. It shows the essential humanity of criminals involved here. It really takes you to that long ago early Vietnam, Kennedy era and what life was like in small town America with this chilling account of a true murder story. The mystery was truly captivating. I found it very interesting to follow a murder that actually occurred. All other murder mysteries I have read in the past were fictional. It was fascinating and even more chilling to know that the content in which I was reading really arose. The writing is precise, clear, and lyrical. The depth of analysis, the sheer amount of work that went into this is stunning. Honestly this is one of the best books I have ever read. I thought I was going to have to wait for the story to build up but the author right from the bat let you know what was happening. I found the writing style to be sufficiently captivating, especially the descriptions of the little things. It really brought the book to life. It is perfectly written with that familiar local prose that puts the reader in the scenes. This is now one of my favorite novels and has definitely had a tremendous impact on my outlook on life and crime. I highly recommend watching that movie after reading the novel.

This was not one that I enjoyed. I truly do not understand the popularity of this book. It does appear to be quite well researched. Due to the poor quality of the writing, a lot of nuance is lost in the descriptions of Holmes and his psychopathy. The title of the book implies something sinister. The synopsis sounded quite intriguing and although non fiction, I was hopeful for a quick, exciting read. Instead I found the book to be quite boring in places and incredibly slow. The book itself is more about the fair rather than the Holmes. Once I started reading I kept hoping for the chapter to end. I do not feel as if the chapters on Holmes were well presented. The passages are few and far between, always jumping around and leaves readers left to wonder what happened. I really struggled to get through this book. I appreciated the story but I felt this was so badly written or edited my overall reaction was to just barely tolerate the book. I probably should have read the description a little more closely. The author thoroughly researched both topics, but he is very detailed. Sometimes it was almost too much detail. I gave it two stars because of its historical significance. I still do not understand the relationship between the the stories other than the fact that they occurred at the same time in the same city. As a lover of true crime I was kind of disappointed on that front as well. Again big build up.

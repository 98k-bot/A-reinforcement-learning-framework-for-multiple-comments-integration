This book is told in a series of monologues by the inhabitants of an Eastern European town on World War II, as well as their descendants in the modern day. It is a collection of those stories along with photos that will creep under your eyelids and stay there for longer than you wish. Each little story begins with an illustration and foundation of the creepy story. The stories reflect the struggle to survive eradication, to assimilate into modern society or face down their persecutors. The book also tells the stories of the humans who live alongside them or subject to them, the faithful, the facilitators, and the prey. There are no ordinary characters, many of them are supernatural beings or creatures who live there in relative peace and prosperity, sheltered from the outside world and working at the local thimble factory, touching upon something deep. It is is one of the most original and captivating books I have read in years. It has bursts of vivid imagery, macabre horrors, and addicting prose. While I liked the interconnected structure, I felt that the world of the stories could have been explored more. The stories are so short, most of them just a couple pages, that I never really felt attached to any of the people or their specific narrative. I would reread portions of it because I could not believe what I actually just read and too my surprise and horror. While it is not for the faint of heart, readers who like a good campfire tale will likely enjoy this book. An excellent read, beautifully crafted, and I recommend it to most. I can not urge people enough to read this one.

I read this in only a couple of sittings for a clear the shelves challenge. This vampire novel is quite similar to the ever night series. This book is all about the friendship bond between Rose and her emotional connection to Lissa. Everything else is just the jello sliding through the spaces of an already full tummy. Although the romance between Dimitri and Rose is hot, yet the book has some issues with Dimitri and Rose. I enjoyed the beginning of this book, not knowing where it was headed. But all too quickly, I was annoyed by all of the unnecessary swearing. The plot is fairly linear, misunderstood girl, teenage angst, unattainable romance, social pressures, a token bitchy rival and of course, the big impending real world climax that makes everything else seem small and insignificant in comparison. The world building leaves something to be desired, and while I might give the next couple of books a chance in the future, this book dragged on a little too long to jump right into the next one. This book is well written but I find the heroine incredibly annoying and the general bitchiness and dubious moral of the supporting characters sickening. Some parts of the book were not detailed. I was expecting more words and it was kind of jumbled. I hope to see improvements in these parts, throughout the rest of the series. The shallow characters and lack of plot created three hundred plus pages of boredom. I wanted to finish the book to give it a fair review, but uninteresting characters and the lack of any sense of urgency, made it a painful ride. So the three stars is a personal issue.

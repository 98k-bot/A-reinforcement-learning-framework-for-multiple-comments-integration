Let us avoid confusing this mediocrity with a great novel. We have here a five star story with a two star execution. This is a dark, depressing novel. The main character, a professor who had an affair with a young student, is not even minimally developed. But no woman, absolutely positively none, would voluntarily remain there when she could leave. The author is more concerned with making a political and literary statement than creating characters with whom readers really connect. The prose is determinedly mediocre, the treatment of violence and its effects is crass. The entire novel fails as a story and becomes an allegory or parable and the characters become representatives of ideas or positions. The violence is abstract and seems to exist solely as a device to explore some of larger problems. The narrative lost steam and credibility. I found the protagonist to be difficult to identify with. I found other characters not well developed. The topic of rape was touched, but there was no resolution for me the reader. This novel provides no insight, memorable images or stunning turns of phrase. It made me even more dubious about important awards. I did not find the book stunning, beautiful or highly inspirational, and at times found it a little hard, a little too crude and confronting. This book seemed more like humiliation, which is the dominant theme. As always, the author portrays South Africa, its culture and its people with brilliance and sensitivity, but this is done better in his other books. Few books have ever disappointed me as much as this one. As an allegory of post apartheid South Africa this book is a nasty mess. A short, and worthwhile read, but nothing amazingly special or spectacular.

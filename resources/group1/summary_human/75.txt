This wonderful book is about a man, Stevens, in his later years who felt he had nearly reached the pinnacle of butler in an era when huge manor houses with huge staffs, were on the wane. Stevens lays plans to motor through rural England to visit Miss Kenton, a woman who, during its glory days, served as housekeeper. The perfect English it is written in, makes you enjoy immensely the tragic story of the stoical behavior of the very proper English butler who will never be able to fulfill his emotional life since he lacks that particular intelligence. I really liked how the story was told, as a series of flashbacks while the main character travels to a specific destination. The way it keeps up with the narrator is evolving thought process is brilliant. The author has held a mirror to so many things, at a range of levels. And beautifully written. That is why the book had received such critical acclaim. If you appreciate a stunningly subtle and yet laser precise portrayal of a man who has spent his days in the pursuit of dignity, then pick this book up. One of the best books you have never read. The author has published only six books so far, but those six books has given him a deserved Nobel prize. The author is able to show significant historical events and culture through the lens of one ordinary person. The way that the author draws the reader into the butler world is truly masterful.

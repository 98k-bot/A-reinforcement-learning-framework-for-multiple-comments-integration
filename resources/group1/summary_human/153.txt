I really hate to even say it but with the hype surrounding this book and people saying it is a christian book. It is falsely advertised. Had high hopes because so many people I knew were reading it. But if I could give this zero stars I would, this book is designed to prey upon women in a vulnerable state and creates a dictation which is honestly unraveled and unhelpful. It was a waste of money. The author seems to want to make everyone happy and therefore refrains from having any strong opinions. There was no real substance to this book. It was a book of fluff and humble bragging from a privileged elite woman. I can not imagine anyone who is not considered wealthy would relate to the author. It is more of an account of a woman who married up and how she thinks she is found some kind of actualization. The examples the author used In the book to make her points are terrible, rambling, and often off topic. Her life is blessed beyond belief but the author writes as if she has, and still is, overcoming extreme odds. There is nothing new or authentic in this book. It feels phony and disingenuous and like an opportunity for the author to self congratulate herself for being fabulous. As someone who reads a lot of inspirational books, there is nothing to sink your teeth into. This one fell very short and no mention of the character who gives us strength and courage.

This is the first novel of the author I have read and it is masterfully written. It is about the wiggly nature of our judgments about what is or is not moral and justified behavior, about how spin makes our human herd so certain that one thing is good and another is evil, about how our self delusions. The author is brilliant across the board, delightful language, plot, characters and anything else you could want in a novel. No wonder this book won the Booker Prize. This book features many realized characters, including Clive Linley, a musical composer, Vernon Halliday, editor of a tabloid newspaper, and Julian Garmony, and important political figure in London. The plot weaves around and around as reader follows the lives of above characters. My favorite element in the book is description of the creative process. Clive was working backward really, sensing that the theme lay in the fragments and hints in what he had already written. None of the characters can overlook their fragility at this time in their lives, and their fears and insecurities will lead them to take drastic actions with tragic consequences. The author remains one of my favorite authors. It is not commercial fiction so some may find it a little bit slow paced. I found the tight plot to be original, witty, and compelling. Read it to the end, and you will be surprised how well the characters have been developed. I did not know until close to the end that it had been building up to a shocking and darkly humorous climax. Once again, this is a masterfully written novel that keeps you thinking for days. I still can not get this book out of my head. The author is simply brilliant, and I highly recommend this book.

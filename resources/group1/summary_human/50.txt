This is a new take on serial killer mystery and I am hooked. The book opens with characters who are not the focus of the story, but set a tense and exciting tone. The story became intense enough in the latter part of this book and the plot moved well. The suspense is too well done. The author combine statistics, science and serial murder in a readable, highly intriguing mystery. His reasoning and scientific problem solving is sound and understandable, easy to decipher. Every characterization and the dialogue are well portrayed. I also liked the cleverness in author thinking and the sheer stupidity of his interactions with actual people. The story picked up pace and urgency, making it an effective thriller or mystery. I read this book straight through, and really enjoyed it a lot fun. I thought I had the mystery solved at around the four mark. The ending felt rushed, as if a deadline forced a chaotic ending. The book would be far better with an epilogue to tie up those loose ends.

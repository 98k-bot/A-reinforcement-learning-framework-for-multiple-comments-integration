I did not read cover to cover, instead, reading large sections. The author who recreates the world of Alain Locke, provides an academic read for academics with citations which weaves together a detailed account. The book presents experiences of an educated black gay man and how the society around deals with this powerful intellectual. Alain Locke studied in Oxford and the University of Berlin, gained degrees in philosophy from Harvard and was the first African American Rhodes Scholar, the elite of the elite. I give the highest marks because of the quality and the attention on someone important and the value for a researcher. The writing is on college level and it is a serious biography for people who want a deep and substantial biography of Alain Locke. Lots of elements including a glimpse into failures, homosexual and cosmopolitan consciousness, Alain Locke influence on the arts and black or white consciousness, all make for a stunning and magisterial work of art, unique to any biography, a quintessential template for how to write a good one. The answer to why Alain Locke is not more well known will come in the end. An enlightening read.

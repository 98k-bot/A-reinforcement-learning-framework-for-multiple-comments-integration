This book was definitely worth my time and I enjoyed the first half of it very much. I am glad to know about the woman whose cancer cells have made such an important contribution to modern science. A must read if you have any desire to explore a case that has sparked a medical revolution and helped fuel the personal information protection fire. However, this book is the second one in a series, merely a springboard for future events. There is no real character development and the subplot is also stupid and annoying. As the book progressed, parts of the book felt rather repetitive. At some point, I felt that the book was over, but I still had many pages to go. It is a bit difficult to keep track of the characters in the story. It also makes you think about how the people and their cells are used in the medical research. This book is to take up space which did not really have enough going on with the main story. The story line slowly picks up from the first book but with some disconnected elements that neither grow the main character, nor does it advance the story in any meaningful direction. The remaining pages lead into unsatisfactory action sequences developed without pretext. The meat of the plot plays out in the straightest and narrowest of lines. Bad guys plot lazily, good guys out think them and evil is thwarted in an emotionless climax. I suspect the author was planning to use this novel as a transition, tying up loose ends and setting a clean emotional table for the next novel. In terms of a compelling read the makes you want to follow it through to the end, I think the book falls down. I am glad I finished the series but very disappointing ending to one of my favorite stories. I could have gone without reading this.

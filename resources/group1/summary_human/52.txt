This book is a Man Booker prize winner but it is a literary gimmick of not naming any place or any person. Although the writing style does not work yet it is unique that has never been tried before. It is miserable and nauseating to read and should have never been published. I did not feel any of the characters because they spoke in riddles and pseudo clever waffling, most especially the narrator. Forcing myself to get through several pages, I just could not go on any longer. It is a very challenging read and could not capture me, with very long paragraphs without breaks for pages and pages and chapters seem never ending, endless and with frequent diversions. The prose was turgid, with long unbroken paragraphs and confusing plot. There are times where the writing flows exquisitely, and other times where I had to read over again. While there are probably reasonable explanations for the vagueness about time and place, but they detract from a compelling tale. This is not a book to pick up when you have a spare minute or two, unless you are willing to stop. You should pass on this one, a waste of money for sure, pointless and rather a bore, very disappointing.

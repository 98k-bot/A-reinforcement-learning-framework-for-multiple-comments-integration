This book seeks about how to more effectively communicate using data. The depth is appropriate for the majority of applications. It looks behind the scenes at how our brains work and how we process data. The author has done an excellent job demonstrating both the how and why information can be clear, concise and compelling. She takes a difficult subject and makes it understandable. She implores the reader to eliminate clutter, visually demonstrates why it is important and its potential impact, then strips away at difficult concepts with clear and concise prose again and again. This book lets me understand good design for better data visuals. And the author concludes each chapter with a conclusion, in the same way with a summary of the key points of the book. Numerous references to further advance interest have also been provided. The book is an easy read and full of very helpful before and after visualizations that really drive the points home. The best part is the author identifies the truly horrendous examples out there then through a step by step process shows how to make them more effective. When I came across this book, it added an extra dimension to my understanding of how I could get the message to the audience. The author achieves even more because she make the proposed concepts more useful for everyone, not only those dealing with large data sets. This is a very enjoyable book that will surely improve the way you visualize your data. You will not be disappointed and recommend for everyone.

I took my time reading this installment in the this series for two reasons. Many people commented on how this installment was unnecessary and that the plot points were annoying fillers. As I read, I kept wondering when I would come across those pointless plot points. And then I reached the end of the book. To me, this was a great installment, and it covered necessary steps in the overall series arch. Gideon and Eva are madly in love, newly married, and still getting to know one another. Gideon is a billionaire alpha male who likes control. Eva is a hard working survivor, new to New York, and maybe to swept up in Gideon. The couple announces their engagement to the public and begins to plan their wedding, keeping a secret that they are already married. Eva and Gideon along with everyone else are great characters, therefore they bring forth a great story. This story is beautifully written and it will help readers to understand and fall in love with Gideon even more. I am going to admit that while I love this couple, the drama was a bit much by this point. All these issues does show growth in their relationship and how they deal with interference so I get why the author has taken this path. I just hope that we will get to see the new and improved nightmare free version. The descriptive, erotic scenes of the author more than made up for the almost painful anticipation I went through before finally getting the book. I am an avid reader and I run through books weekly so to hear that I will have to wait until book five is release does not sit well. Still captivated by Eva and Gideon, cheering for these two all the way. I think people forget that this all happening in a very short time frame, great strides are happening in a short amount of time so do not be a hater, I think the author will get us there, we just need to be patient.

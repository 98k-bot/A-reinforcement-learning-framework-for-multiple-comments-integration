This is the best book of the author. It is a book that can open up a new world of understanding and a new way of being for someone. It takes a minute to get into the book but once you do, it is snowing awakening, especially for those who goes through life upsets like cancer. It teaches you to have mental peace. I have been reading this book for years and years. The writing takes away a lot of the loftiness and the lessons are extremely comprehensive and compassionate. The author writes about truly deep subjects without feeling or sounding heavy or overwhelming. Reading this book feels more like taking a walk with a friend who has great practical insights into the way things really are. The concepts presented are adapting to a reality that we may not be accepting at the moment. I read each chapter twice. The message of loving kindness and compassion towards ourselves and others is pure love. Complete anxiety meltdown that rendered me almost incapacitated. The writings gave me the strength to get through very difficult times and learn to hold myself dear. I have now been able to share my experience with others suffering as I did. This author has a delicious sense of humor and she is often very funny. And that is one characteristic that seems to be so inherent in Buddhists. This book taught me why I have never been able to meditate. It has helped me to be able to move on in my life. The author has the unique ability to write in a way that you feel like a loving friend is giving you really solid, helpful, kind advice that is accessible. Her wise counsel and perspective goes through you as a life jacket when you think you are going to drown. The title of this book is so ridiculously deceptive but there is advice for difficult times.

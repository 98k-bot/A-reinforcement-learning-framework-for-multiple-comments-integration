This book does not go into each sort of normal body signal, yet unquestionably enough to keep you occupied for some time. Body language is a significant component of human interaction. Interpreting body language accurately is a major component of emotional intelligence, which drives success. I think this book did a good job in discussing the more commonly observed ones. What this book successfully made me realize though is that I send confusing mixed signals to guys I like. This book provides an introduction on what to look out for eyes, surrounds, touching, smile, legs, feet, and the other parts of the body. I believe this book is to be excellent for a man who wants and needs to know what a woman is thinking, whether he indeed stands a chance with her. Wonderful healing book, the author gives you the healing practice for the illness that you create through your mind, explains the emotions that you may have caused the illness, and also the colors to work with when healing. Everyone should have a copy of this book and work with it for better health. If you are as blur as me on not verbal depictions, then I strongly recommend that you buy this book. After this book you will simply understand if any girl is interested in you. This is very good book that I recommend to any men. Good written and very practical.

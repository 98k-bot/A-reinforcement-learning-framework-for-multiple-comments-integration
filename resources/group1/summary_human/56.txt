The real problem of this book is that it is too long. However, the main themes remained the same. So in the extensive rehash of the speech, one is treated to an endless repetition of the same material, pretty wordy and exhausting as a rhetorical device. Frankly, it becomes boring. I was annoyed at the liberal snobbery in the introduction of the author. As I read further, I will surely be alert for liberal bias sure to come. Meanwhile, the obstacles to appreciating this book are consistent and irritating. The author makes much of inconsistencies. And when the author refers to the differences, there is a superior, smirking quality to the prose that does not sit well. This book reads like a psychology undergraduate who had to complete a last minute book report on the autobiographies. It is a difficult read, with little to no pay off. The writing is self consciously staged and thus cannot be entirely relied upon. The observations are not particularly trenchant or useful in understanding. The author does his best to fill in the blanks, but there are limits to what he can do. Another problem is that the slavery, inherent in reading, was horrible. The book has not reflected exactly how hellish life was for the four million that endured life in dehumanizing, degrading system. The other issue is the tendency to guess at what is not known.

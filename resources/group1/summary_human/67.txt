One of my biggest complaints is the reliance on jargon in the novel. He has got some made up word in practically every paragraph, and it is often difficult to ever figure out what he is talking about from context. Things are moving along, a climactic battle is in the works. It ends in such a way that does feed consumption of the next book. The frustration that I have is with the concept of prescience. I like the overall concept that prescience dose not mean that someone can or will know everything in detail, and that there are blind spots. The author frequently implies that, but then pulls back. This was one of the first novels I loved when I first began reading Science Fiction. After decades I find it less enthralling. The esoteric segues created less tension than a sense of get on with it. I imagine the fans will be calling for my blood, but themes or tropes that disappointed me now. This book has been a challenge to get through. Much of the first half consists of esoteric philosophical conversations, but the pace has improved in the second half. There is probably no more complex and imaginative world than that created by the author on the desert planet. The characters are one dimensional. He never truly suffers. The things that were taken away from him were things he never wanted anyway. I can not say the same about the kindle version. The formatting needs a revision. First off the chapters start with the first letter of the first word much larger and bold. It is attention to detail is beautiful and the way it composes action in battle is superb, but even with that the book is seemingly written with blinders. It spends countless pages hyping up the child of prophecy, the one who will change the world. If you are looking for a fun and entertaining science fiction read, or a solid expensive feeling version of the book to read, look elsewhere.

What a wonderful book. Suffice it to say that I will be going all the way back to the beginning and proceeding from there. The main characters were very well developed and fit so well together. The author has written a story full of sweetness and hope. These two people are truly better for being together. The author escaped his country revolution that took the lives of family and friends plus their wealthy properties. He struggles financially as he lives in a rental house in England where the servants are lazy refusing to do their work. The staff is slovenly and disrespectful, even thieving. The heroine, Elise, starts to shape them up, a Herculean task, while also trying to turn the Prince Philippe up sweet. I like the variety that the author brings to her characters in the series. In this book, the hero and heroine are both mature adults. That tends to be the case where the heroine is the housekeeper for the hero. I should have known better than to start this book after dark, as it meant I was up into the wee hours devouring it. I felt Elise was a great version of a plucky heroine. Such a heroine is one of my favorite characters in this series. I love the whole series and I thought this was another great one to this series. I also loved the pacing of it, the gradual understanding between the hero and heroine, and even the descriptions of the home the hero lives in and the home he had lost. Several scenes made me giggle or laugh aloud, and authors can make me blush right along with a character. Elise and Lavay are fantastic together. There is a lot of humor in their interactions and each wants the best for the other. I liked watching Lavay come to realize the importance of the loyalty of Elise and that restoring his past is not as important as creating a future full of love. The son Jack of Elise, is adorable and I love Lavay interactions with her son.

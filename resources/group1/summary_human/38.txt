This book sucked me from the beginning. I could not wait to find out what happened next to the two narrators. Two men,an Iraqi and an Iranian soldier, intersected both their lives because of the war, who keep going when life is the darkest, survive years of torture as prisoners of war. Although the information I learned was hard to digest, yet it is a truth. I wondered just how someone can face such a life. There was a hope that they could be returned to own country at the end of the war. Characters were alive on each page. The resilience is incredible. The author makes a claim as to why wars should not be fought and weapons of mass destruction can cause what end. The author took you on the journey with the characters. With all the ugliness of war, human kindness and hope shine through. I could not put it down and I was not disappointed. It deserves five stars, although colored and exaggerated, yet I am certain the stories are a true record of those memories, and totally captivating.

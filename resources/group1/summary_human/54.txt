This book is not fluff and is indeed important in social criticism canons. It is a classic and superb mind blowing story but timeless in setting up the futuristic utopia. The author imagines a world where government controls all aspects of life, moral restraint has been eliminated and hedonistic pursuit is the fashionable existence. Sexual intimacy no longer exists and is simply a part of recreational activity. Elements of imagination are intriguing without prescience. The story also lacks the narrative flow that transforms an interesting idea or concept into a good story, too late to become emotionally attached. The author has little interest in memorable character development or plot whose writing is prophetic of society today. The characters are two dimensional for the most part, rather monotonous and predictable with a lot of dialogue. I grew rather tired and I found myself waiting for a twist but did not see any of these, looking at page numbers and wishing I was finished already. Moreover, do not bother with the Kindle version. Specifically the one with the picture of the eggs and blood. It is completely different from the version of the physical book and I gave up pretty quickly. Chapters did not line up and the frames and graphics are too small to see. There were entire pages of conversation missing towards the end of the book. It changes the prose and wording to make it more readable and understandable in more modern language. It is still kind of disappointing that I wasted money on a book which is seemingly advertised as the original.

This book definitely lives up to its name. I do not know of any other author who can blend romance, humor, action, and devastation into one book and it come out this perfectly. I love how the story tied in, and made so many pieces fall into place. The side characters were definitely an added touch to the brilliance of this book. The chemistry between Liis and Thomas is amazing. They both have private affairs to deal with, but they are also both married to their jobs. I have read and reread every book in this series, numerous times. I have falling head over heels in love with these characters and I have hated them equally. I love learning more about Thomas and his life. Thomas was super sexy, confident and deliciously masculine right from the beginning. He will melt your heart, make you swoon and get under your skin. Powerful and his presence demanding, yet has a soft spot for women he cares about. I am truly shocked to read some of the other reviews by people who were disappointed with this book. I loved it. It did seem like it jumped around quite a bit more than the other books but I still liked this one. This is one of my favorite authors and she won me over yet again. I like how all the stories have their own plot, yet, have a continual plot weaved through it. Loved it and will definitely be recommending this book to my friends.

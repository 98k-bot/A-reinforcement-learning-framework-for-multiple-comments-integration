This is a grim, gritty and shaggy tale of a wasted life, slow spiral down, also a hopeless and dark haunting book without much joy. It offered a realistic and heart wrenching portrayal of a girl life in prison and the sad back story that led her being there. The author has opened a window into the brutality and humiliation endured in prison. Readers who need to know more about life in prison will enjoy it and thrive. The story is the most depressing one without happy ending. I kept going until the end, hoping something reasonable would come out of it, but spoiler alert it did not. The writing is real and excellent. It grabs you until the end. The author is a talented writer who makes you see, hear and feel the desperate humanity of her characters in bad luck. It is a fine job of taking readers on a ride into lives and places that you would never be or go. A fabulous read and exceptionally well told.

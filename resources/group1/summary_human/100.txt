The author take the magic of this book and rewrite the history of your room so its spotless. This book asks the question if you can change the history of an object can you do the same with a soul. I was thoroughly engaged in the characters, and finished the book wishing I could spend longer in this world. I enjoyed the concept, even if I found it a little shaky. I liked the character and the set up. But the ending was disappointing. I like short stories but they are very hard to write because the ending needs to be really punchy. Unfortunately the story itself is just not very fulfilling and feels like a badgering moral tale. One of the reasons I fell away from fantasy is because of the over abundance of unpronounceable, forgettable names. It moved too slowly at first so that I put it away for more interesting reading until I had some extra time. In that I am disappointed as there is so much potential in the character and where he can take it. Thought the concept was alright, but did not quite get the changing somethings history thing. The author could have easily made this into a full length novel where the main character goes deeply into the psychological profile. The one problem I had was, I just wanted more. It is like getting a taste of an interesting story, but only have access to one of the chapters. A good and short read. Would still recommend it to someone looking to pass the time and but not necessarily someone looking for a moving, soul changing novel.

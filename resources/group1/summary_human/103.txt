I have waited a long time for this book, and I was not disappointing. Like other series, this book is well written. I was a little concerned when the author announced that he was stepping away from the urban fantasy into the realm of epic fantasy. This new enterprise went like the wind. I was sucked into the maelstrom from the moment I read the first word. This book introduces a new, steam punk style setting and a big new cast of interesting characters. The story took place in a very interesting world. The world is generally steam punk but with a novel and interesting magic and technology system and terrific battles between airships that blend the best of naval encounters. There are a good half dozen major and minor characters introduced in rapid fire. The characters are likable and well developed with amusing quirks and strengths, and the action was surprisingly well choreographed. The characters have clearly distinct personalities and are believable. The author has provided original plot and more in this book. I love this the sense of humor, ability to create original characters set in a wonderful world created in author head. An added bonus in this book is that the women are not weak damsels in distress that need to be saved by the big strong man. What is absolutely promising about the potential of this series is that although the first installment is absolutely fulfilling, so little has been revealed about these wonderful spires. My only complaint was that the author did not spend a lot of time explaining things early on so readers were left to discover a very intricate world without any real guidance. This excellent book was hard to put down. Highly Recommend.

I was disappointed that actually it was really just a love story, which I was alright with for about the first fifty five percent, but then I got to the point of finding it boringly predictable. This is the third and final book in the series. This tells the story of Flossie Jayne. A woman who decided to work and live somewhere besides with her parent home. She is an artist and seamstress. She moves into a boarding house. Where she tries to make the boarders her family. Her Job with Tiffany takes her to the Chicago World Fair and back again. Flossie is an extremely naive and immature young woman who had no idea what real life was like outside her home. The writing is okay and I felt the book was too long. It could have ended much sooner. Reeve Wilder is a little peeved at his new next door neighbor in the boardinghouse, because the walls are thin, and he can hear everything she and her roommate talk about. As for Reeve, after finishing the book I can not even remember anything about him. The book is very well researched and sticks real close to historical events. The pace is quick. But I was bored out of my mind. It also seemed that the author could not decide when to end the story. I gave this book three stars because truthfully the characters, mainly Flossie, annoyed me. This story has the expected sugar and niceties but has some surprising spice tossed in. I love this author, but I requested a refund. I stopped at chapter twenty. As usual I enjoyed the historical parts, but life is too short for the annoyance.

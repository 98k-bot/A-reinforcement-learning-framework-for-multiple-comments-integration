The proposed investigation has a potential impact that it might define the future political battleground of our nation. We have all lived through the endless lies and red herrings that thrown out by Trump base. And yet, reading the the book wipes away so much of the false smoke and mirrors and shows. The investigation in fantastic and organized to be read in a short time. What makes the fact immediately apparent is the additional reporting and commentary provided by the Washington Post. Providing background and depth to the actual report. The content is well put together and everything is interesting and there is no political commentary. The introduction, list of individuals and time line add a great deal. There is also a very long list and brief descriptions of all of the key individuals mentioned in the study. This list can be referred back to so that you do not lose track of the various personalities and who they are. Although the font size is small, yet the book includes other important documents connected which show intelligent selection by Washington Post staff. The report is so large, it is better to buy the print edition in multiple volumes than the kindle one. The nature of this report makes it almost unreadable on a kindle. For paperback version, there is just something about being able to physically view, on paper, two pages at a time with all the footnotes that makes this an easier read. So, if you are bored and have a long rainy weekend, go for it.

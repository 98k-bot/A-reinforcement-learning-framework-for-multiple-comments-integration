This is quite possibly the most insightful, existential book I have ever read. The author has given us wisdom in its purest form. Every sentence is mind profound. This is also a very complex book. I had to read it twice before I started to understand what the book was really about. If you are apt to reading philosophy, profound books that give you insight into the universe and your place in it, I cannot think of any greater book than the this one. The author has been called the philosopher king of Plato. He rejected luxury and comfort and reminded himself to always be favorable to all that came by him. The story builds in a steady relentless way, which creates a vivid sense of claustrophobia and madness. The style of the illustrations is definitely distinctive and creative, even bizarre, earthy and abstract. There are a lot of translations and this is probably the most coherent. It is light and clear while retaining a classic grammatical style that lenses the text a feeling of heft and authority. This version of meditations strikes just the right tone. If you want to become familiar with this particular stoic philosophy, I would probably start with this one and save yourself a lot of aggravation. I have read and reread this volume. I now have a much better understanding and appreciating of the intellectual ability of the western ancients. One recurring theme is the brevity of life and value of time. It is a funny and weird feeling to read something that was written two millennium ago but applies to our lives in many ways. I enjoyed the book and found the concepts simple and straight forward to apply to every day life.

My first time reading this book and it definitely left a good first impression. This book was an awesome ride into the largely uncharted new adult paranormal frontier. This is a clever, fantastic urban fantasy with a number of strong characters. I was laughing up a storm at some parts, and holding my breath at others. It read like a thriller, a mystery, and a romance all in one. The tension between the two main characters was palpable, and the supporting characters were amazing. Two heroes, Ivy and Ren have quite a job trailing and figuring out who is the big bad behind all the ruckus in New Orleans. Ivy has a dominate personality. Ren has show that his compassionate and strong. Physically and mentally. Ivy is a part of the order that protects humans against the Fae. Ren is a transfer from Colorado and very mysterious. Together, they must find the person who is betraying the Order to the Fae, who wants to open the gates to come through to the human world. Cal found Ren bruised and injured two years ago and healed him. Cal get pretty close to Ten and things escalate between them. In my opinion, this book had everything the strong kick ass female main character who is extremely likable. The character build up and development was good. The writing was exceptional and the story plot sucked me in and that ending. Once I pushed past the slow beginning the story began to pick up and it soon got to where I did not want to put it down, I just had to know what was going to happen next. The chemistry between Ivy and Ren left me desiring what they had. What I really loved about wicked though was that it was new adult. It seems to me like there is a large gap of good, quality, paranormal romance missing from the New Adult genre. It is a great story and I will finish it. I can not wait to see what happens next. Good job. Great read, and quite steamy.

This is a story of great soul men and women who persist through a fantasy world obstacles, was well worth the time and money spent on it. It is the second book in Bujold World of the Five Gods trilogy. In the first book, Cazaril was a great main character and I loved his story. Ista was not a strong character at all. But this time, the story centers on Ista. Ista comes into her own, and there is something very satisfying about having an intelligent, irreverent forty year old woman finding adventures and purpose. Her entourage is amazing, I cannot pick my favorite character since they are all deep and round. Ista was god touched in her youth, which basically means that she went insane for an extended period of time. I appreciated the new point of view the author was able to achieve by taking someone we knew a bit about and then looking at the world through her eyes. Also, at times, the prose is so exceptional, I felt I was reading a work of Shakespeare if he were a contemporary author and writing novels instead of plays today. The relationship with the characters is very intimate, showing their thoughts and motivations with such delicacy and skill. The story feels natural and consistent with what we knew before but now things can move in a new direction. The author is the only fantasy writer I know of who has somehow managed to capture the essence of a genuine religious experience in all its indescribable complexity. I would recommend this book to any fans of the author and any lovers of richly build fantasy worlds.

The book was listed as in very good condition. Well there is writing in the book. The first page after the cover was glued in defectively. I was crushed up and flattened to fit inside the book. There is no plot and a boring silly unrealistic story, no real characters. However, I know this book has generated tons of controversy. I feel like much of the criticism was spurred by jealousy. This book is written from the perspective of a barely educated man, Balram, who has grown up in the poor section of India which he calls The Darkness. It interesting to get the perspective of Balram, a villager turned driver turned entrepreneur. It was eye opening about the caste system they have. Balram was forced out of school and sent to work in the city. The book tells the tale of his struggle and gives insights and philosophical observations about Indian politics and the corruption surrounding it. The book had a plausible story line. The author did a good job of keeping it interesting and having the reader involved. Some of the descriptions of rural life were very realistic. Narration of the story is really catchy. But as an outsider, the picture of a highly nuanced society is lost in ridiculous characters. I would recommend it to anyone who is in between books and is looking for a good piece of fiction.

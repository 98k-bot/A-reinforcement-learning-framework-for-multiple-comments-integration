About half of this book is mesmerizing, both in the originality of its plot and its lyrical language. It starts somewhat slowly, but once the main character arrives in California, the story really takes off. Overall, the plot is plodding about a boring spy which makes the book a dull read. It should have been one hundred pages shorter. Gives insight on the aftermath of the Vietnam war by a refugee, this book took me back to the Vietnam era and the Boat People era, and that is a time when there were few sympathetic characters. Characters are empty and not engaging. I could never find any connection to the main character. I was disappointed in this book, and marvel that it earned a Pulitzer Prize. There is no heart, emotion in this novel. The writing itself does not convey true emotion coming from anyone. The author admits in an interview that he was not brought up to show or express emotion and, therefore, finds it difficult to write about emotion. This book does have some redeeming qualities. The struggle over competing loyalties and philosophies is often expressed well. I appreciate the mental acrobatics that requires of the reader. My problem is the last part of the story which seems to go nowhere good, and very slowly at that, very little happens. This book gives not one acknowledgment of the hundreds of American lives sacrificed for the country of Vietnam, painting Americans as arrogant bastards throughout.

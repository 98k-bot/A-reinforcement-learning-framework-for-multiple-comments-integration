This book presents an important topic and is relevant to today society, from the eyes of a black teenager girl, Starr, who is courageous, hilarious, resilient. The story line is comedic and gripping and easy to digest. However, this book is filled with mundane conversations and details about inequality and prejudice which added nothing to the plot. The beginning was so powerful that the rest could not live up, a bit predictable. The characters are too stereotypical to be believable. However, the book sums up the lifestyle and tribulations many kids love. They are from in two worlds, are ingredients of this story that lead to an exciting climax with several important sub themes. The story is powerful and eye opening and heartbreaking. It is a generational exploration of some of the thorniest issues reflecting the nuances without weakening the punch. Some parts of this book are happening right now and very little is being done to stop the epidemic. I am grateful that the author wrote this book shows the tenacity and strength of Starr and her community. One of my best reads that we must watch for. I can personally relate to some of the events that take place in this book and I cried, felt anger, sympathized, learned and laughed.

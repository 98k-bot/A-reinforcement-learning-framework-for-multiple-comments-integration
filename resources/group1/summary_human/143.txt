The writing makes the information about society role in a person life easy to read and digestible. The book follows the lives of two people from birth through death to illustrate how the human brain works and to highlight some of the best available knowledge. It is very much written in the style of a documentary having to do with the human body. We see Jane waking up in the morning and bumbling to her bathroom to take a shower. Millions of cells and nerves have been awake and busy all while she has been asleep. Then the camera focuses in on her arm or face where a graphic or animation of internal activity takes place, demonstrating action at a cellular level. The story is written in a story way most of the time, following a few main characters on how they meet, get married, have a son, and how their decisions affect their overall outcome in life. I particularly enjoyed the customary and careful craftsmanship of this author, never over arguing a point. His moderate and even handed understanding of humanity was comforting and accessible. The author weaves a narrative with some of the latest research in psychology and other sciences. He provides what might be fairly dry information in a much more compelling way. The scope of this book is immense, and his straightforward journalistic style makes it an easy read. There is so much material to think about that you should not read several chapters and then discuss these all at once. A good gift for any life long learner type or those who appreciate what is below the surface in human interaction. I gave it one penalty star for one minor reason, gender generalization. The book made me cringe at times.

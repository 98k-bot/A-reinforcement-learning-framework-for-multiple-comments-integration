This is the second book of this author and just like her first book it is being marketed to both a Christian and secular audience. It is like every motivational and self help speaker you ever listened to got quoted. I am pretty disappointed in this book. I did not find anything new or of substance in this book. It felt like a product that was rushed to get to market, lacking depth. The author is all about helping women obtain the tools they need to make their dreams come true. But, much of her advice rings hollow when compared with reality. The difficulties she identifies overcoming are also so vastly overstated. It was so terrible, I actually think I lost brain cells reading it. In my opinion, the author comes across as a snob. What I could not get past is the repeated use of profanity. There are much more intelligent ways to express a point than using profanity. In one point in the book she talks about how her mother threw her a party and she was ashamed of it and never wanted to be that way as a mom. I found this book to be vapid, unfulfilled. I can not say I would recommend this one. This book is a waste of time and money, a garbage. Even if you can get it for free at your public library, save yourself the time and choose something, anything else. So, do not read this book. It is boastful and promotes a position that is contrary to scripture.

This is absolutely required reading for anyone who enjoys history, urban development, or biography. The story took me back to the beginning of the twentieth century in New York. I could almost visualize the city, with is growing populations of immigrants, the industrial growth with all the grime, dirt, and corruption and here and there remarkable stories of hope, vision, and courage. The story of Robert Moses is in many ways the exploration of the growth of modern New York City. The author offers reader so much by explaining how power in local governments works and how individuals can wield their influence over people and projects indefinitely. What I appreciated most about this book are the efforts in defining other power. The book details Robert Moses life, his intellectual brilliance, and his careful crafting of his path to virtually unlimited power. His accomplishments are legendary but what is less well known is how his stubborn conceitedness ruined many of the aspects of City life and destroyed any and all who opposed him. Moses is such a disgusting figure. He painted himself as the selfless public servant. In reality, he cast people aside by the thousands in order to increase his power and accomplish what he wants. This book rates as one of the best most interesting, fascinating well written books I have ever read. It is known as a classic with good reason. This is a study of what makes a bad person who accomplishes great things tick. Overall, this is a very thorough historical work that is definitely not dry in its narrative style and should be read by anyone interested in power and motivation, hard to put down.

I admit it took me a chapter or two to really get into the book and understand what was happening. This is one of the best science fiction and fantasy, especially for the concept that tech class of the crashed star ship transforms themselves into the Hindu pantheon to rule the passenger descended populace. Using science fiction to explore one most influential and dynamic parts of human history is an ambitious undertaking. It is a almost unique mix of science, Hinduism and Buddhist philosophy. The focus is on the life and goals of one known variously as Sam, Siddhartha, and the Buddha, who strives to bring freedom to the descendants of the original colonists. Buddha and Hinduism have a relation that is depicted in this story, the reactionary nature Buddha against Hindu is realized. The book contemplates timeless and universal questions of evolution and religion and politics, all with a fairly unique backdrop. The author has quite a way with words and brings witty humor into his writing. The lesson the author might teach us is that self like all else is an illusion. It is a wild romping adventure, full of poetry and beautifully classical narrative style intermixed with bits of modern satire. The author offers a scientific perspective for how advanced technology becomes indistinguishable from magic. If you have not read this the author classic, don not miss this book or for that matter almost any of the Hugo winners. I truly wish the many now out of print novel like this book.

This book is about a character from that series shows up midway through the story, and a lot of cross references occurs. The ending was a bit of a let down, following the familiar path of setting up a final confrontation between the monster and the heroes. The book did not feel like it was even written by the author. Its main downfall is so derivative that if he was sourcing off another author it would come close to being called plagiarism. I got the book and, it did not grab me like other books. Now sometimes I have trouble getting a clean download because other people have had access to my kindles. Some of the characters in this book might be lost in some of the story line. I thought the book was almost too long. The story took an opposite degree turn about a third of the way in though, deep into typical type. The author changes things up with a quasi criminal procedural. The procedural portions were weak and boring. I never really connected with the characters because they were two dimensional and not very interesting. The supernatural premise of the book also fell flat and was not at all scary. The demise of the bad guy was anticlimactic. There was a lot of talking and I wanted more action since there were no tongue in cheeky comments and asides which I heartily miss. If I had not paid full price for the book and had known its connection to the Mercedes novel, I might not have even finished it. I kept waiting for the peak, for the classic investigation of what we all consider, but it never came. I have a hard time seeing the author being motivated by the first two and the book does not feel like the latter, so I am left wondering what this is an allegory for. This book just fell very short of what I have read in the past.

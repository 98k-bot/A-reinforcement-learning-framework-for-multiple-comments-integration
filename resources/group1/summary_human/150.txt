The book has a great topic but did not dig in as deeply as I would have liked. The basic message is restated repeatedly. And it offers good reminders but is more vague than specific when sharing personal experiences. I have not read any of other books of this author, but this one made me think she is really going to regret putting it all out there in a few years. While the bulk of the content, including the premise, of this book was good, and the author had some very quotable material, I was not a fan of her writing style. The focus is taken off of God as our strength. I did find the own personal experience of the author missing. I feel we received more of her thoughts on her heart, rather than on the actual solid details. Large swaths of white with stark black lettering may be fine for chapter headings but the whole pages are extremely choppy. The main idea of each section is spoon feed with short sentence. I cringed through a lot of this book. The first half of the book was very transparent but it was a struggle to get through the last few chapters. The book was heavy on being a bible lesson and to destroy us and light on how to get victory to overcome them. This is not a book I would tell someone to read. And, if you need coffee table read to perk you up a little, then this is a great book. For an older adult, the book is too theologically shallow. Thus the book felt disappointing.

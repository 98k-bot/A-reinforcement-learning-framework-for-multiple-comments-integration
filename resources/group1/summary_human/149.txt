This is the most comprehensive and practical book I have bought on cooking. It is the best text about cooking I have ever read. It is both logical and fun so the lessons will stick. I would call it perfectly balanced, like a great meal. It dives deep into the elements of good food, the nature and use of salt, fat, acid, as well as how to apply heat to prepare delicious food. In just the first section alone, there is enough information to transform every dish you make. Nearly every bit of information on the proper way to salt is new to me, and diametrically opposed to all that I learned as a young woman. I flipped through it extensively when it came in. I love that the contents are not photos, but rather hand drawn looking pictures done in a water color way. The author shares an extraordinary skill set organized in easily understood teaching modules. My guests were in awe and freely praised my cooking. Now I really do feel comfortable in the recipes of the author and I am following the suggested cooking lessons, which begin with something as simple as soaking and simmering beans to achieve optimal saltiness. I knocked a star off because there have actually been a few minor science errors presented as fact. If you are looking for first principles to get started cooking, then this is the best combination of education, recipes, and reference guides. And, if you want to elevate your home cooking without going off to culinary school, do not miss this great book.

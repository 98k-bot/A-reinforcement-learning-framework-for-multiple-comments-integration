I absolutely loved this book, excellent envisioning of the cyclical nature of a developed society bent on destroying itself, told through several events. The book is fabulous, and highlights some of the memes of the time that threaded through a number of different science fiction masterpieces. This is a timeless novel, as relevant today as it was when it first came out. The book is divided into a few different periods of time exploring the themes and is original, believable, darkly humorous and profound. Abbots in a monastery are driven to preserve the past and they do not even care about what is happening in the outside world. There are many chilling passages that sneak up that left me thinking, worriedly, about the future. How we never seem to learn from our mistakes and an appalling realization that we could be all bent on self destruction. Story jumps ahead a few hundred years when the human race seems to be back on track with scientific advancement. The religiously motivated philosophy of the author is made fairly clear throughout the work, and will not be to everyone taste, but it was to mine. I became very attached to many of the characters and especially to the Abbey. The view of the future runs the gamut from humorous to catastrophic. There is also an unusual ending which addresses mutations, preconceptions about mutations, impossible to predict. I am not sure I could say enough about how much both my husband and I loved this book. However, one would think a hardcover would have some quality to it, but this is like the cheapest paperback you have ever seen. The paper is of newspaper print quality, the text is small, and the pages sometimes stick together near the binding.

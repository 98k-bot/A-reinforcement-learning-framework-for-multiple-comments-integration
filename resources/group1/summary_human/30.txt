I really enjoyed this novel. I feel that this novel will transport you back in time with some lovely moments throughout. It is a complete page turner. Written in an interview style, the book is providing an oral history of a rock and roll sensation. I loved the world that the author captured of the old music scene. The background of characters was rather standard for the music scene with substance issues. The engaging book has the feel of the movie, keeping switching to another bystander with different opinion. The narrative is quite readable and a fast read because of the way the book is structured. I did appreciate it to hear a variety of different perspectives of the same times and events, quick jumps back and forth between different people which rounded out to fill in the story. It is a convoluted and complicated book just like all the best songs are. Anyone who is a rocker or classic rock enthusiast will love and hate the characters in turn and all at once. I can not recommend this book more and can not wait to see the next series.

This book is lacking the usual dynamic story line and suspense, predictable and just a lousy story with the worst and bizarre ending. Unbelievable events and characters. Events were not resolved and questions were not answered. The story has not presented interesting conflicts and you will not wonder how the plot is going to work out. The book exposes our vulnerability to fraud and misdirection. The author uses some big words infrequently to show he has some intelligence but it is formulaic, pedestrian language like a poorly written soap opera than a good mystery. The story ended suddenly. It just left the reader hanging. Spelling mistakes abound. Editing is almost non existent. The plot is simplistic and not at all what I expected from the summary on the website. I paged through and read chapter here and there, but my opinion did not change. Awful. This was not up to the usual Robin Cook stories I have always looked forward to reading, a waste of time, so disappointed.

Where I was expecting book relevant to every part of our nation, women rowing north seems to largely. Unfortunately, after reading positive reviews in two major publications, I found I did not get much value from this book. Technically the author is a good writer, however it was so very depressing to read that I wanted to throw it across the room. This was a very wordy book, giving example after example, using only first names and it was hard to tell when the author was changing the person in the example. The stories included are not of women flourishing, but of women languishing. The first pages are excellent, which is why I purchased, but I stopped reading by page thirty or so. I was looking for more than a rehash of feminist precepts. This is not the trailblazing book I was hoping for. I felt the author was saying older women need to find love with a partner and grandchildren or else they are doomed to a lonely and unhappy old age. The author needed to listen to her own advice in the second half of her book. We make our own happiness. I do not agree with the idea that we need to find happiness in others. I was bored throughout this entire book. I kept waiting for some insightful comment. Never got one. It read a bit like a memoir. And I found this book very depressing. The subtitle mentions flourishing as we age, but this book seems to focus more on gritting your teeth and getting through it.

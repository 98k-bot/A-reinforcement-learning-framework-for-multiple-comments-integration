This is the third book in the Hades Hangmen series and can not be read as a standalone, all books must be read in series order. This book contains graphic and disturbing themes, which can be triggering for some. There are not enough words to adequately express my love of this book. The author hit it out of the park with this book. It is brutal, raw and passionate. This is a beautiful story about two souls who are drawn together not just because of their broken lives but for the hope that love can heal what can still be healed. Flame and Maddie are so inherently broken, beaten down to tiny, minuscule pieces. They all suffered unspeakable trauma at the hand of a religious cult, but each displayed completely different ways of coping. Flame is is very solitary in his life. The tattoos, scars and the self cutting are what makes others stay at a distance. Maddie was introduced as well in the first book of the series, but it is this book that you are brought to understand why Maddie is one of solidarity as well. Maddie was a wonderful heroine, oddly perfect for him. Flame was an enigma, and I needed to understand this damaged, broken man. I love how Maddie was the strong one. I usually do not like that, but with Flame it works. Maybe because Flame was still the strong crazy, but Maddie was the emotionally strong one. Characters were well written. I never cried so hard for any man in a book I have read. It is that kinda cry that soul crushing you could not even shed a tear. This book is beyond amazing. Very well written. It touches on some really tough subjects of abuse that tear my heart out. I never cried so hard for any man in a book I have read. It is that kinda cry that soul crushing you could not even shed a tear.

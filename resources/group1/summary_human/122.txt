This book was alright, good enough to entertain me for a few hours but it did not generate the same amount of excitement for me as the first two books in the series. This one started okay but Ben is lack of visible need for Lizzy was a turn off. I just did not understand this story why was Ben so afraid of commitment. I did not like Lizzy and Ben at all. The immaturity and washy attitude of Lizzy was so difficult for me to get into. I could not believe that Ben had any real feeling for Lizzy at all. I honestly do not expect Ben to stick around. When things get tough he kept saying sweet things. He seemed turned off and runs away. I wanted to scream at him and say hello. In between being together and then seeing each other again Ben was with other women. I felt he left Lizzy alone to deal with everything and when he finally decided to give her the time of day she was supposed to kiss his ass. His personality was non existent, much like his character throughout the book. This felt more like a chick lit than a rocker romance. The start of Liz and Ben relationship was cute with the flirty text messages and felt promising, but when the text stopped so did the little bit of chemistry they had. Which I guess is understandable, since he and Liz were rarely together. I was also disappointed with the story line around Martha coming back. She was a true bitch to Liz several times. Some of the angst just went on and on. And the sex was too much and too graphic. The author should also do research into touring bands. There is no such thing as sleeping in and having breakfast.

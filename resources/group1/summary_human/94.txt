The dialogue works, but there are a number of problems with the whole post series Veronica Mars. There is no depth, no meaning. The book was written too much like a script. All I kept thinking while reading it was that there was way too much detail in describing elements not really essential to the scene. It felt less like I was reading a dime novel mystery that happened to have some characters from Veronica Mars. I had little to no feelings for the characters involved and it was highly predictable. There were several scenes that attempted at emotional but instead felt more awkward and hard to read. The books try too hard to tie into previous events and existing characters instead of taking advantage of the freedom to expand. Nothing inherently wrong with this novel, it is just somewhat of a paint by numbers thriller. The story had a few unexpected twists and turns that kept me guessing. I thought they were good twists. Everytime a character was mentioned in the book I felt like it was only to connect the story to the TV show. I would not have finished this. Our heroine was not herself. And neither was anyone else. These are our characters all grown up. I was disappointed in this book. I thought some of the principal characters acted out of character a few times. The mystery is okay but the writing lacks the wit and charm that we have come to expect from these characters. I did not think this attempt added much of value.

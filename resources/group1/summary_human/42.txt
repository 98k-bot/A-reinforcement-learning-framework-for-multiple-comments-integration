This story full of needless twists, ridiculous tense shifts, uneven pace, flowery description, confusing time hoping, heavy telling, passive voice and back and forth from present to past. I liked the idea outlined in this novel and the beginning was promising, but then it all became overdone, contrived, tidy, simplistic, repetitive, too many fillers. The story itself did not appeal. The characters were predictable unless they were being boneheaded silly. The author should try trusting that the reader has worked and is well acquainted with the practice. I was lost, did not quite follow the narrative and there was way too much telling, not enough showing. The writing was weak and it ultimately made the novel unreadable. The story took too long to get started and the reader had to wade through too much background in the past before the main characters took center stage. I gave up after reading, many cliches to note. I understood the twist about half way through the book, not recommend, really disappointed.

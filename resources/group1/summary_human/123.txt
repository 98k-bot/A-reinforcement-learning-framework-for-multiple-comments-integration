The author never disappoints. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it was different enough to feel like a fresh start and because the author writes very complex and imperfect characters and that makes the tales more believable and real. It grabbed me from the first chapter and I read non stop until I finished. I liked the plot and I liked the characters. There was betrayal, secrecy, suspense, conflict, desire, and hope. An affair ruined two families and later brought new lovers together in a fight for their future. Emotional walls are put up and brought down, put up and brought down in a steady pattern. About the eight percent mark in the book there is a new twist and I could not put it down. This is a story about two people overcoming mistakes of their parents, allowing their closed off walls to be penetrated, and learning and allowing to love. Their pasts are connected in a not so good way, but the connection between the two of them is intense and off the charts. Alexa was funny, sassy, she was stubborn and determined. She never gave up on Caine. She knew she could help and she did. Caine was sexy, and pure alpha. Most of the book I wanted to throw something at him for his behavior but I also found myself trying to protect him. Caine Carraway has moved into my top ten list of sexy, alpha, hot, brooding, broken billionaires. I loved the amount of time Caine and Alexa spent together and the amount of dialogue they had. I also loved how they were the focus of the story and not the sub plot of their past. The best part of the book is every once in a while the terrific writing style breaks through enough to keep you interested. By the time, twists were all resolved, everything tied up a bit too neatly in the last few chapters. I expected more from this author. Not a bad book, but I know she writes a lot better than this. All in all, I am so glad I read this book because I did like the book and it is a good read, I just wish I had loved it more.

I enjoy this book and as a reader, I maintained a feeling of hope for the incredible job of historic storytelling. This was an interesting and somewhat unconventional take on the effects of slavery on slave and master. The characters and their world are fascinating and well drawn, and I found the book very entertaining. Two main characters make an unlikely pair, and this is in some ways an unlikely adventure novel. The narration of the main character offers insight into being a slave, then being dependent, and finally finding himself whole. The writing is excellent and the narration is engaging. The insight into being born black is a must read for white people. The author leads us through a story that has many levels and explorations of what it means to be captive. A compelling narrative, this book is the kind of novel that makes me want to go back and reread it as soon as I finished. Themes of pain and suffering we both experience and inflict resound through the story. We readers embark on a voyage filled with pathos, joy and heartbreak. This is a beautifully crafted novel. Luck is its own kind of manacle, sometimes not for us to choose, or even understand, the one granted us. I highly recommend it for those who love history and dynamic storytelling. The surprise and ultimate reward of this novel is how it upsets some of that, while also confirming that certain things will come up or be dealt with. This book was a pleasure to read as the story is so well written.
